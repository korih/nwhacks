    "question": "I've been working on problem set 1 and noticed that when I receive the autograder report, it says:\n\"For further explanation of autograder messages and\npolicies see https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/psets/autograder.shtml.\"\nBut the link is non-functional for me. Is there any important information we need from that link? Thanks!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Thanks for the note.  We'll correct that.\nThe autograder messages have gotten much easier to understand in the last 6 months, so you should be OK with just the report.\nAsk here if there is a message that you don't fully understand."
