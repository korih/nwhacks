    "question": "hi i just had a question about the new problem set policy. as mentioned in note @275 it says \"you must submit a single shared assignment for both students.\"\n1. does this mean that if one of the partners submit the problem set, the other partner will get the same mark even if they didn't submit anything of their own?\n2. do you count the last submission submitted before 10pm Sunday still? if I'm assuming we need to communicate with our partner to make sure that our last submission is the one we want to be graded\n thanks",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "You and your partner should be working together and submitting together. You shouldn\u2019t have two different versions."
