The function works correctly,\nbut the function purpose, tests, as well as the accumulator types and\ninvariants have deliberately been left out.  You must fill in 5 things:\nfunction purpose, type and invariant for acc1, and type and invariant for\nacc2.  Your invariants must be specific to the behaviour of this function.\nSaying something generic like \"accumulate the data\" will receive zero marks.\nYou do not need to fill in any tests.\n|#\n\n(@htdf foo)\n(@signature (listof Integer) -> Integer)\n;; purpose: Produce difference between the sum of odds and sum of evens in loi\n\n\n\n\n(@template (listof Number) accumulator)\n(define (foo lon0)\n  ;; acc1 is: Integer\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;; invariant: Sum of all odd numbers in (listof Number)\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;; acc2 is: Integer\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;; invariant: Sum of all even number in (listof Number)\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  ;;\n  (local [(define (fn-for-lon lon acc1 acc2)\n            (cond [(empty? lon) (- acc1 acc2)]\n                  [else\n                   (if (odd?
