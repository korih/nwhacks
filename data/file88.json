    "question": "I'm not receiving the spd hand-in emails, and I'm not sure why. I have received them before for all the other practice problems I've done but for this one I didn't receive anything. \nI changed the ??? in the CWL section in the document to my CWL. I checked my spam folder. My cs email is activated and set to forward to my personal email. \nI also tried emailing my cs email, but it didn't forward to my personal email (gmail) :( ",
