    "question": "Hi,\nI'm working on an HtDF question and I keep getting this error: \ncheck-expect: expects only 2 arguments, but found 6\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can fix this? I don't exactly understand what it means. ",
    "student_answer": "It's hard to give help or hints without seeing the code you're working on.\nBut from looking at the check-expect documentation: it seems likely that you have a missing parenthesis somewhere, so Racket thinks that the check-expect expression is much longer than it is.",
