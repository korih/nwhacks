    "title": "Lab Grades Affected due to Excused Absence?",
    "question": "I was feeling a little unwell earlier, and although it's better now, if I end up not being able to attend my lab this afternoon (L2C), how will that affect my pset grading and lab check-off mark? In the syllabus, it says we are to fill out an academic concession form and work on the lab individually and can get help from OHs or Piazza, but not anything about attending a make-up lab...",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "\"In the event of illness or another valid reason for missed work, you may be able to get an excused absence, which will appear as a -1 for that particular lab or problem set in Canvas. Note that this does not excuse you from needing to know the material covered in any missed lab or problem set \u2014 it is your responsibility to cover the material you miss. If your absence is not excused, you will get a 0.\""
