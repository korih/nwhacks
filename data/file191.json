    "question": "Hi, I'm having hard time figuring out q5 from problem set 1.\nWhen I hand in the set with the correct picture/caption I still get a 0%. \nWhen I try the code a different way I get this error : give-caption: expects 2 arguments, but found only 1.\nI've been re watching the lectures and figuring practice problems sets but still haven't figured it out yet. Are there certain practice problems anyone would recommend? ",

    "instructor_answer": "I would encourage to slowly read every line of the problem description again. Many people run into difficulty with this kind of problem just from not following the problem instructions in detail."
