    "question": "I was wondering if the file that we hand in cannot be run for whatever reason (I had some issues with finishing problem 6) that the autograder won't be able to grade any of the previous problems either?",
    "student_answer": "Yes, I believe you don't get any autograder points for problem sets and labs if there are running issues with the file. If it's just a problem with tests failing, the penalty is less but bottom line your file should run without errors to get points. \u2800",
