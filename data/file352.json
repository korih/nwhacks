    "question": "Hello,\nI was wondering if we are allowed to wear earplugs during the midterm to block out ambient noise. The mitdterm 1 page mentioned that earbuds/headphones of any kind are not permitted, although would earplugs fall under this category as they are not electronic?",

    "instructor_answer": "Non-electronic earplugs are fine, though you will need to ensure that you do not miss any announcements or messages from the invigilators. "
