    "question": "Do you always have to make new check-expects for the new abstract function every time? or can you use the pre-existing ones without changing anything ",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Get into the habit of making new check-expects to show that you can use your abstract function for functions beyond the pre-existing ones, given you designed your abstract function properly, it should be able to handle other functions!"
