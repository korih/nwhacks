    "instructor_answer": "@6 please\nAlso, one thing we know about learning is that questions just asking to explain something don't really help with long term learning.\nInstead take some time to play with this, perhaps using the stepper, and then ask a more detailed question explaining more about what you do know and still don't understand.  Questions like that take a lot longer to ask. But all that time is actually helping to build the learning."
