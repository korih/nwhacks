    "question": "I am a little confused how passing this course works. For example, if I got 75% on MT2 does that mean I need 25% on the final or are they weighted differently so I would need a higher score on the final?",
    "student_answer": "@1006",
    "instructor_answer": "Two things have to be true.  Your overall course grade has to be >= 50%, you can compute this using the weights in the syllabus.  Also, the average of your MT2 and final grade has to be >= 50%."
