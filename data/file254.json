    "title": "Unable to Register for Lab Section - (retaking CPSC 110 this term)",
    "question": "I failed this course last term and I'm retaking it this term. Although I managed to enroll in Section 203 by submitting a change of registration form, I'm still blocked from registering for a lab section due to an error message that says: \nAdd was Unsuccessful.\nA grade or standing already exists for another section of this course. Registration for this section not permitted. For enquiries, contact your Faculty.\nI've already emailed cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca twice last week, as well as earlier today, about my situation. I understand that students who are taking the course for the first time are prioritized, but I was just wondering when I'd be able to hear back? The add-drop deadline is tomorrow and I'm quite worried...",
    "student_answer": "What worked for me was I emailed CS Advising describing the situation and they sent me the change of registration form to fill again with the details of the lab section that I wanted. After 1-2 days after I sent it back to them, I had gotten registered in the lab section I wanted. However, since you\u2019re in a time crunch right now I\u2019m really sorry and hope you get into a section soon!",
