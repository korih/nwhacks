    "question": "I have a pretty complicated CWL password so it's impossible for me to remember it. Would I be allowed to keep open a text file with my password in it so I can easily use it during submission? \n(Note- during mt1, I copied and commented the password onto the problem starter file and then removed them right before submission. I repeated this for every problem. I found this a bit tedious so I'm asking now.)",
    "student_answer": "You can also change your password to something easy to remember now and then change it back after the exam. ",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
