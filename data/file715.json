    "question": "I know that in exam instructions it say that if you do not understand the instruction then re-read question. If you still do not understand then explain what you understand in comment.\nI wanted to know how nice is the marking for this? My english is not perfect and programming makes it a bit hard. I am asking also because sometimes the question will not allow me to do the question the way I want to because my logic is wrong. What is it like in this case? Especially with auto-graded questions.",
