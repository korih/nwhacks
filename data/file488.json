    "question": "Really want to be sure I understand MR, but so far I would consider the Green and Light Purple (bottom left) arrows R, not MR.\n(source)\nAre these MR because they reference each other via third (or fourth) functions?",
    "student_answer": "If you follow an arrow and it ends, it's a reference.\nIf you follow an arrow and get back to the same data definition in one cycle, it's a self-reference.\nIf you follow an arrow and go through multiple data defintions but eventually come back to the original, it is a mutual reference.",
