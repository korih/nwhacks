    "question": "Recordings of the 2021W1 lecture streams are now available at http://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/lectures.html.\nRecordings up to yesterday's lecture (L09: BSTs) are available, and future recordings will be released on Tuesdays and Thursdays after section 201 finishes class. This term's online lecture recordings (up to Friday, February 4) are also still available in the Zoom Cloud Recordings tab in Canvas. \nPlease note that we are providing these recordings to encourage students to stay home when they are feeling unwell, and for review purposes. As specified at the beginning of the term, our lectures are based on live activities which research shows improves learning. If you are unable to attend lecture due to illness, you should do your best to work through the lecture activities for practice when you review the lecture recording.\nAs a reminder, we do not provide exemptions for missed lecture quizzes, but we automatically drop one week of everyone's lowest lecture scores to allow for the occasional missed lecture.\n#pin",
