    "question": "I thought I received an email about where to Go to for the exam but it seems like the email was regarding another midterm I have. Are students who write the exam with the centre for accessibility considered \u201cStudents who have been approved to write the alternate exam\u201d?",
    "student_answer": "\u201cStudents registered through the Centre for Accessibility do not need to fill out this form to receive exam accommodations such as extended time. They should only complete this form if they cannot write the regularly scheduled exam due to one of the reasons above. If you have exam accommodations such as extended time, you must register for the exam through the CFA exam portal according to their specified deadline.\u201d from @599 suggests that unless you had an exam clash or other extenuating circumstances, you would just write the exam and the regular time and location but with your required accommodations :)",
    "instructor_answer": "Please go to the CFA exam centre in Ponderosa Annex C."
