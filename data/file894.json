    "question": "Are the commented examples we make for the accumulator considered scratch work we have to get rid of before submitting?",
    "student_answer": "I don't know for sure, but I know my TAs wanted to see them before they checked me off for lab 10, so expect they will want to see them for during lab grading next week. (i.e. I think keep them, just have them commented out like we saw in class)",
    "instructor_answer": "you can submit a file with examples on it. That's ok."
