    "question": "I just started practicing the old 2020 finals and I was wondering if we can expect those finals to be similar to ours in difficulty/material? Or should I be practicing other problems too?\nnot to sound annoying but they seemed easier than I expected the past finals to be.",

    "instructor_answer": "The way you choose to prepare for the exam is entirely dependent on your strengths and abilities. \nIf you did really well on the second midterm then focusing on the past finals may be the best way to go.\nIf you struggled on MT2, then working through past midterm 2 exams in addition to final exams would be beneficial. \nWe always recommend that students work through at least 3 past exams to get a sense of the types of questions, length and difficulty. \nThat being said, no 2 exams are the same. \nWorking through an entire exam in exam like conditions (no distractions, support materials, timed) is a great way to prepare. \n\nIn addition, after you have done a few exams you may notice that you seem to struggle with a particular concept, working through all the question bank questions for that concept may be helpful.
