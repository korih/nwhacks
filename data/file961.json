    "question": "Just wondering what the best way is to start studying. I know doing the practice finals is essential, but I was hoping to go through the material again before trying those.\nWhat problems would be best to go through first? Lecture starters? Redoing problem sets from scratch? Redoing labs? Problem bank questions? Or working on practice midterms?",
