    "question": "I\u2019m a little confused on which things we need to hand in in DrRacket. Do we need to hand in the stuff we do for the chapters? \n\nFor example, in 1a, do we need to hand in the pythag-starter.rkt in question 1?",

    "instructor_answer": "The content and practice problems available under the modules (i.e. 1a, 5b, etc.) are for your understanding and learning, not for marks. The things that do need to be handed can be found on the syllabus, under the Course Organization section:\ncs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/syllabus.html"
