    "title": "is it possible for the autograder cooldown to be removed for the opened problem sets and labs?",
    "question": "just wondering if it was possible for the autograder cooldown to be removed since these are just for further practice and would save a lot of time especially since some people like to submit after they complete each problem.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "The reason for the cooldown has always been that it should help you to learn from the problem better if you convince yourself that you are correct before submitting.  Try doing several problems at once submitting as you go. That's the closest thing to simulating the exam situation that you can get."
