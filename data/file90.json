    "title": "Question about before lecture work",
    "question": "Hello,\nThis might be a really bad question but I'm a bit nervous I'm missing something.\nI finished module 1a and at the end it states to make sure to do the pre-lecture work for lecture 2. Was module 1a and the practice problems at the end of it the pre-lecture work? Would there be anything in Module 1b I would need to cover before Thursday's lecture?\nGreatly appreciate any help",
    "student_answer": "Officially, yes. But since htdf will be covered in the coming lecture it would help to start on that.",
    "instructor_answer": "In your section's lecture pages, each lecture page has 3 parts:\n  - What to do before lecture.\n  - What to do during lecture.\n  - What to do after lecture.\nThose parts of the lecture pages tell you what work you need to do around lecture.  The course schedule page tells you about labs and problem sets and exams. "
