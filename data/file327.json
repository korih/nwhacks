    "question": "Hi, this is the program we did in lecture, the compound data for the spider, I'm confused why we need to do CTR-X twice? I know the second one, like CTR-X 21, but I don't know why we need to add CTR-X 0, could someone please explain what does that represent? Thanks!",
    "student_answer": "@6\nbut that's because of how the add-line function works. It's drawing a line from the top center of the screen to the ctr-x at the spider's location. ",
