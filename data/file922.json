    "question": "Does anyone, want to study CPSC 110 with me for the final every day on zoom or on campus for like 1hour -2 hours? \ntext me at  7787239296",
    "student_answer": "I am down!\nZoom would be preferable to on-campus, if possible. \nExcellent idea! I may just steal your idea for other courses as well :D",
    "instructor_answer": "Great idea.  Studying a couple hours a day every day will do a lot more for you than waiting till a day or two before the exam and putting in the same total number of hours.  Also remember these study tips that we know are helpful:\npractice actually solving problems starting with just the starter, reviewing solutions is not very helpful\npractice during office hours, when course staff can give you hints instead of you having to look at the solution\nspend at least some of your practice time in exam like settings - no distractions, 2.5 solid hours, just starters and recipe sheet"
