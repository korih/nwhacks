    "student_answer": "Your grade in each lab is calculated using your autograder score and the score that your TA gives you out of three for attendance, behaviour, and check-off. The grading scheme is as follows:\nIf you get 3/3 for your TA score, your lab grade will be your autograder score\nIf you get 2/3 for your TA score, your lab grade will be capped at 80%\nIf you get 1/3 for your TA score, your lab grade will be capped at 60%\nIf you get 0/3 for your TA score, your lab grade will be 0\nIn other words, if you do not attend a lab, you will get a 0/3 as your TA grade and thus receive a grade of zero (unless you are granted academic concession).
