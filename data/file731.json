    "question": "Hello. I was working on the accidentally released midterm's p4. I came up with the following solution (that works):\n(define (count-duplicates los1 los2)\n  (local [(define (string-in-los2? s)\n            (ormap (lambda (x) (string=? s x)) los2))\n          (define (add1-if-duplicate s rnr)\n            (if (string-in-los2? s)\n                (add1 rnr)\n                rnr))]\n    (foldr add1-if-duplicate 0 los1)))\nHowever, the instructions state that for full marks I need a composition of two functions. This does not count as a function composition, correct? If it isn't a function composition, how would I go about modifying the code so that it is a function composition?\nThank you!",
    "student_answer": "you might want to see @713 . built-in abstract fn in local doesn't count as two-fn-compositon\nyou can use filter with folder instead.",
