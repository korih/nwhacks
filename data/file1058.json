    "title": "context preserving accumulator vs results so far accumulator",
    "question": "Could some clearly define the difference between the namings of these? I find that although I can use accumulators correctly for the most part, I'm not quite sure whether it's a context preserving or rsf accumulator that I end up using. If you could, maybe provide an example? Thank you in advance!",
    "student_answer": "A context preserving accumulator is used when previous information in a list is required to make operations on the current element in the list. An example would be if I wanted to determine if a list of numbers is in ascending order. At the current element in the list, I would need information about the previous element in the list to determine this, so I would need a context preserving accumulator.\nA result so far accumulator is used for tail recursion. When the result of a tail-recursive function is a list, a result so far accumulator is needed to keep elements that fit a condition in the list, since structural recursion with cons cannot be used in TR. An example of a rsf in use is in any tail-recursive function whose output is a list.",
