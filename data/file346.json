    "title": "Booking Exam with CFA",
    "question": "Hello! I was just wondering when booking exams through the CFA, whose information should be put on instructor information? Should it be the instructor for our section or should it be the course coordinator Emily Fuchs? When I went in to book, I saw that in instructor info it has Emily's name and the email emilyef@cs.ubc.ca. If we do put down Emily in the instructor info, should we use that email or the cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca email? Thank you in advance!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Emily is the best name to put. I'm not sure which email address she prefers though - she will answer Monday.\nEdit from Emily: Please include my name (Emily Fuchs) and emilyef@cs.ubc.ca when booking exams through the CFA portal. "
