    "question": "Hi, I was just wondering if build-list can be used to build lists with more than just numbers?",
    "student_answer": "Yes, and you can check 2021w1-mt2/mt2-p3\nFrom the language tab on edX:\n(@signature Natural (Natural -> X) -> (listof X))\n;; produces (list (f 0) ... (f (- n 1)))\n(define (build-list n f) ...)\nSo yes, build-list makes a list of a function applied to numbers.",
