    "question": "Hi guys! I was struggling with the last part of the setup where you enter your CWL and password.  Here's how I did it and it worked for me. I hope this helps anyone struggling with it.\n  Step 1: Make sure you change the yellow highlighted part with your username that has 8 characters\nStep 2: Save the file. I saved it as \"Save Definition As\" \nStep 3: click SPD Handin and enter your CWL and password. You should get an email and it should say \"Handin Successful\"\nHope this helps :) ",
