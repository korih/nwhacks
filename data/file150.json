    "instructor_answer": "With apologies to the Dr Racket team, I don't use the help desk.  I find it often has install problems.\nIf I want to look up rectangle, I type  \"racket beginning student xxx\", and then I make sure to choose one of:\n     Beginning Student Language\n     images.rkt\n     universe.rkt\nfrom the choices it offers me."
