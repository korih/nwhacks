    "question": "Hi, I left my lab early today after I finished, but when I left, the TA was not in the breakout room. Is that okay? Did we need to be checked off before leaving?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "You do need to be checked off! If the TA isn't in the breakout room you should stick around and wait for them (likely/hopefully not long). In this case, given the timing you should still be able to rejoin the Zoom meeting and move yourself into a breakout room.\nThe relevant text from the syllabus is:\nEach lab will involve the design of one or more programs graded by the autograder, as well as a check-off question asked by your TA that you must answer before leaving the lab.\nPlease check the syllabus for items like this before asking on Piazza. That makes Piazza work better for the very many questions that do need someone to write a specific answer for."
