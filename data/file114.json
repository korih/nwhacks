    "title": "Lost points on Test Thoroughness when handing in lecture work",
    "question": "After following along and working on the lecture starter  (m01-htdf-starter.rkt) today, as well as completing the fourth problem we didn't get to, I submitted the file to the SPD Handin. However, it says the test thoroughness for problem 2 (which we did in class) is not enough. I tried adding another test case, but that didn't work. I don't understand what test cases the problem is missing. Thanks:) ",
    "student_answer": "I think you need to add a check-expect where the string is just \u201c\u201d because I had the same problem but after adding this I got full points for test thoroughness.",
