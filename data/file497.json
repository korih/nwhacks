    "title": "Charging laptop during exam",
    "question": "Will we be provided outlets to charge our laptops during exams? (MT2 + FINAL) (the lecture room does have outlets everywhere which is working perfectly, but highly doubt it will work in SRC)\nMy battery life is pretty bad - it can last maybe 1 hour tops. 0 problems if I can keep it always plugged in though.\nThinking of getting a new battery / saving up for new laptop if we can't charge.",
    "student_answer": "You can be rest assured that if they are giving an online exam, they will provide us with the means to do it, meaning there will be outlets for charging or alternative arrangements made. They won't give the exam as an online exam without ensuring everyone has equal access to it, don't worry. And if it\u2019s in person, then I believe there are also alternative arrangements like letting you take the exam on one of the computers in the lab if your laptop cannot go the whole exam without charging. They have experience, so rest assured!",
