    "question": "does the name of (@htdw) have to be the same as the name of (@htdd)?",
    "student_answer": "No, they don't always have to be the same, for example you could have a data definition called Fruit but you might want to do a world program that puts fruits in a basket, so FruitBasket might be a better name for the @htdw here. Alternatively, you could also name the @htdw Fruit, but in the end it just comes down to what's convenient for you.",
