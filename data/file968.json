    "question": "Hello, \nI know some of my other courses are doing review sessions as opposed to standardized office hours. Are there any TAs, or professors, that plan to work through final problems with students before the final?\nIf so, where can I access those zoom links?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "I don\u2019t believe that we are doing review sessions. But, if you have a problem (or more than one) you\u2019d like to go over during office hours, we\u2019d be happy to go over that.\nWhat I\u2019ve done during my office hours before is go through problems as a group, getting student\u2019s input on where to go in the next step, and providing guidance if needed. That way students can learn from each other, go through the questions that they wanted to go through (and that other students in the OH wanted to go through) and be in a productive learning environment. If it is what students want during my OH on the 19th, I am happy to structure it that way (it does depend on the natural flow of the office hour though; no guarantees.) And, come to think of it, that\u2019s what I found to be super helpful in my own studying for the final exam when I took the course.\nSo you can think of it as a \u201cstudent-guided final exam review\u201d if you\u2019d like, but it is not a review session."
