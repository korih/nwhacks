    "title": "Defining parameters",
    "question": "When defining parameters for functions in a local, they could technically be named anything. \n\nexample: \n\u2026(local [(define taller? strawberry banana) \u2026)]\n\nhowever, what is the naming convention when we have more than one function in the local that operates on the top level data. Do we still use the same parameter? \n\nexample: \n\u2026(local [(define (fruit? x) (\u2026))] \n             [(define (vegetable? x) (\u2026))]\n\nor should it be something like this: \n\u2026(local [(define (fruit? m) (\u2026))] \n             [(define (vegetable? n) (\u2026))]\n\nsince we are passing the same data through the functions, I would believe it\u2019s fine. However then we would be defining two of the same thing, which doesn\u2019t sound right to me. \n\nThanks \n\n                ",
