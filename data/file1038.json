    "question": "Quick question, on the final will we get docked marks if we make sth TR when we\u2019re not told to make it TR?",
    "student_answer": "If we're not told to make it TR, it probably won't matter.\nHowever, if we're told to make it not TR, or if we're told to not make it TR, you shouldn't make it TR.\n(sorry for semantics)",
    "instructor_answer": "Sometimes we don't specify, other times we might specify SR or specify TR.  So definitely be able to do both."
