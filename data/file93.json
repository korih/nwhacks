    "question": "Hi, I was apparently unregistered for a lab section and I quickly added one after realizing my mistake just now. I wanted to ask if there was any way I could view the previous lab, or if I could be aware of anything that I missed. Sorry for the inconvenience, bit disorganized since the start of this year from having covid : (",
