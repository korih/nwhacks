    "question": "The course staff is aware that some students have set up a Discord server for the course. This happens every term, so we know what we want to say about it.\nSpecifically, we encourage you NOT to use that Discord server for at least two reasons.\n- Course staff will not post in it. That means that there may be incorrect advice given there, and if you base your work on that advice you may lose points on problem sets, labs, or exams.\n- Based on the experience of 10k+ students, the course has a very specific academic misconduct policy.  This policy is designed to improve midterm and final exam scores. Using the Discord server to ask questions about problem sets or labs before they are due would constitute academic misconduct, for which the minimum penalty is 0 for the assignment and a referral to the Dean's office.\nPiazza is the best source to use to ask questions about the course, get answers from other students and staff, and build a community that helps everyone do the best they can in the course.",
