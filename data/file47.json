    "student_answer": "If you go on EdX and click on Section 201 and 203 under Lectures, it contains all the pages corresponding to what we're going to cover in each lecture. The pre-lecture material you'll need to finish going over before that day's lecture is always located at the top of the page. For the first lecture, (tr - L01), all we need to do is make sure we've set up DrRacket according to the instructions on the Setup Page. ",
