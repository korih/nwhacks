    "question": "If Genrec is included in the template and being used in a function, are we always obligated to write a termination argument?\nI see that it is necessary for strictly genrec problems (ex. fractals), but if a graphs or search problem uses genrec, will we be deducted marks if we do not include the termination argument?\nOr as a general rule of thumb we should always include it?",
    "student_answer": "You need to include a termination argument whenever using genrec. ",
