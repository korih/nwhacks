    "title": "Return nth element of a list",
    "question": "If I had a list of elements, and wanted to take the nth element in the list (i.e. something like (predicate-name n lon)), is there a predicate that we learnt that could accomplish this? I feel like this was covered in past material but I wasn't able to find it in starters or in Racket documentation. Thanks for your help.",
    "student_answer": "You can use list-ref for that. Where (list-ref (list \"a\" \"b\" \"c\") 1) returns \"b\" (zero based indexing). It\u2019s in the documentation/help desk as well.",
