    "title": "Local lifting",
    "question": "When a question asks for how many definitions are lifted for a given function when it is called, are we assuming ALL functions defined within local are always lifted regardless of whether the function actually uses it? So for example:\n(define (b n)\n  (local [(define (one x) (* x 1))\n          (define (two x) (* x b))\n          (define (three x) (* x n n n))\n          (define a n)\n          (define b (* n n))\n          (define c (* n n n))]\n    (one (two (three n)))))\nhere when b is called, only 4 of the local definitions are actually used but regardless, 6 definitions are lifted?",
