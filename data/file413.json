    "question": "Hello, I have a question about the invigilation during the midterm. Will we be sharing our screens throughout the exam? I noticed on the midterm information page, one part said\n\"This exam will be invigilated using Zoom. You must turn on your camera and leave it on throughout the examination and an invigilator may also ask you to share your screen at any point during the exam.\"\nBut the next paragraph said \n\"Throughout the exam, you will be sharing a live video feed. The invigilators will be watching to ensure that you are complying with the rules governing the exam, as we do during a regular in-person exam, except by using the web camera video.\"  \nDoes this mean we will be sharing our screen throughout the exam? The two paragraphs seem a bit conflicting since the first one says we will turn the camera on when invigilators ask us to do so, but the second one says we will be sharing the live video feed. ",
    "student_answer": "I wrote the waitlist quiz, where we had to share our live webcam feed of ourselves for the duration of the quiz and we only had to share our computer screen with the Zoom 'share screen' if the invigilator asked for it. I assume that the exam will be in the same format, but please someone correct me if I'm wrong.",
