You should be able to submit and get feedback on your practice work. \nRemember that:\n Practice exams are for your practice only. They are indicative of questions we have asked before, do not assume they include every kind of question we might ever ask.  Also practice with problem sets, labs, and the problem bank.\nThe autograders for the practice exams are intended to be illustrative.  Do not assume that the exact details of what one autograder checks will be what happens on the midterm.",
