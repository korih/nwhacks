    "title": "Question about clicker",
    "question": "Hi!\nSo today we had a question during our clicker question which was about which step is first in the local evaluation rules. In the videos that were assigned for pre-lecture work it says that the first step in the evluation process is renaming the variables. During the clicker it was said that you must lift the variables first. I am not sure which one is the process we should be following and am finding it quite confusing.",
    "student_answer": "In the stepping process, all 3 actions occur in one step. So, the order in which you rename/lift doesn't matter in the stepping process.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
