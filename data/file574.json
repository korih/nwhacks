    "title": "Question from EdX 5b",
    "question": "Hello, for this question, shouldn't the answer be empty? Since the stub takes in a string and list and produces the list, when given an empty list shouldn't the function produce empty?",
    "student_answer": "Nevermind I got it, I didn't realize the stub was commented out and the actual function puts them in alphabetical order.",
    "instructor_answer": "Remember that the check-expects are written to describe what the function should do.  The stub does not contribute to our understanding of the check-expects, it only lets us run the check-expects before the full function exists."
