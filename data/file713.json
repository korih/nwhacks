    "title": "build -in abstract function in local",
    "question": "Hi, I wonder if this function considers as a  composition of three - build-in abstract function or two build-in abstract function? (since ormap is in local)\n\n\n(define (A s t)\n  (local [(define (c1 fs)\n            (ormap (lambda (x) (string=? fs x)) t))\n          (define (c2 f rnr)\n            (+ 1 rnr))]\n  (foldr c2 0 (filter c1 s))))",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "No it is not.  It is a composition of 2 abstract fns.  The result of the filter is handed to the foldr, so that filter and folder are composed."
