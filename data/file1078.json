    "question": "Hi\nI just have a quick question about the grade. I did the final yesterday and I didn\u2019t think I do very well on that too. I have already failed once for this class. If I fail this class again, should I apply the form to the faculty of science because this is the prerequisite for my major.\nThanks",
    "student_answer": "In the case you really fail the class, contact science advising for next steps, they will want to work out a plan for you if they do let you retake the class. Until then get some rest, tests usually feel worse than they really were.\nGood luck!",
