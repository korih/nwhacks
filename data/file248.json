    "question": "Hi, I was testing out a code from the lectures and when I tried to run the code, it says the following:\nDoes anyone know what's wrong?",
    "student_answer": "It\u2019s weird that this is happening since it\u2019s a lecture file, but I believe why that error is showing up is because (require spd/tags) needs to be at the top of the code for @htdd to work, just like how primitives like rectangle and circle won't be defined until we have (require 2htdp/image) at the top of the code.",
