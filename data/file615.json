    "title": "Earbuds for noise not allowed?",
    "question": "Hi,\n\nI always wear earbuds to protect myself from noises in exams. But I saw one bullet in the midterm 2 instructions saying that \"Wear earbuds/headphones of any kind.\" are not allowed... Does that mean I cannot wear my foam earplugs to prevent those typing noises around? It will be really uncomfortable...\n\nThanks~",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Non-electronic earplugs are permitted but earbuds/headphones are not. If noise is a significant distractor for you, I would recommend registering with the Centre for Accessibility as one of the exam accommodations they can provide is a distraction reduced environment. "
