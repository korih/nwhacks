    "question": "Hi, I'm wondering if we are to hand this \"in lecture\" work in via the SPD hand in button and is it for marks? Or is this solely for practice and no need to hand in?",
    "student_answer": "I believe the graded lecture component this term is the iClicker questions and not the lecture starters, but it\u2019s recommended that you hand in the lecture starters anyway for practice and to get feedback on them.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
