    "question": "Hi, \nI have a test that is failing at the next-ball function after I wrote the helper function. \nI copied it to check whether it will also fail at the helper function itself, but it passed there, so what can be the reason that a test fails at the tick function?\nWhere should I look for an error?\nThanks.

    "student_answer": "Read through what the next-ball function expects and does. Your logic is probably incorrect somewhere. ",
