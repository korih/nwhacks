    "question": "So from last 2 weeks I am unable to focus on my study and I get lag behind and for the midterm 2 how to cope up and cover syllabus. Can any professor or Ta can help me in this ?I am feeling demotivated and On midterm 1 I got 40% . So, I don\u2019t want to get low marks in midterm 2 . Please help me in this.",
    "student_answer": "You can study with me, and I will be happy to help you. It would be beneficial to me as well.",
    "instructor_answer": "Please come to office hours and a TA / instructor can help you on an individual level, and can probably help make a study plan for you to catch up on material. If you have any specific questions on a module or a module that you\u2019re struggling with, this is also where office hours can come in handy.\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019ve recognized that you need support in the course and are reaching out. As the student answer mentioned as well, studying and learning with others could also be beneficial.\nCatching up on this much material will require a lot of dedication.\nI\u2019d first recommend starting off with watching the videos to ensure that you have a base level understanding of the concepts that you\u2019ve missed, as well as fully understood where you went wrong on Midterm 1. Do the practice problems on Edx, and ask for help where you need."
