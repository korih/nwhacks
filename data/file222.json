    "question": "Hi, I have problems with my iclicker which loaded for a very long time to take me into the class, which lead me to the absence from today's class. It let me miss the time for check-in. Could this kind of technical issue be forgiven of the absence of the class?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "It should help to start connecting to iclicker sooner, as soon as you start getting ready for the class.  "
