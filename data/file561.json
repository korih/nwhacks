    "question": "If I submit the problem set before cooldown, does the grade be reported? does the code be submitted? or nothing was submitted.",
    "student_answer": "As said, signatures, check-expects, and their thoroughness are being checked, but it is submitted the same as other submitted codes. The instructor just marks the last submission, no matter if it's after or before cooldown time.",
