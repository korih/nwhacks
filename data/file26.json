    "title": "Labs for waitlisted students",
    "question": "I am a student who has been waitlisted for this course. I know we are not allowed to attend labs until we are officially off the waitlist, but since we do not have the course on canvas where will we be able to access the lab material?",
    "student_answer": "The lab material will be in the EdX course, not the Canvas course so you should be able to work on the files but just not be able to hand them in and get them graded. However, I believe you\u2019ll be exempted for the labs you missed while on the waitlist when you get into the course.",
    "instructor_answer": "You are still responsible for completing the labs and handing them in (spd handin, please follow the setup instructions if you haven't already). Please refer to the schedule on the syllabus to determine which lab you have to complete (one lab per week).\nFor all labs, including future labs, should you have any questions about anything related to the lab (anything course-related EXCEPT for problem sets), you may go to any of the listed office hours :)"
