    "question": "This week I tested positive for covid and have been having pretty bad symptoms which are getting worse that have been preventing me from doing much school work at all. I had been exempt from the lab this week already but I had also submitted an academic concession form for problem set 9 as well because I've barely been able to work on it in this state. However, I haven't heard back yet and I'm worried that since it's the weekend now I won't get a response until Monday. So I was wondering is there anyone else I can contact? I'm really worried I won't be able to complete the problem set on time\nThanks!",
