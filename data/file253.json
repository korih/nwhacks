    "question": "Students who wrote and passed the waitlist quiz on Tuesday evening have now been moved into the course. If you did not write the quiz or did not pass the quiz, you will not be moved into the course. We will not be directly sharing the results of the quiz, you will know whether you passed if you have been moved into the course. \nOnce you are moved into the course, please register for a lab section that fits your course schedule as soon as possible. If all of the lab sections that fit your course schedule are full and you are unable to register by tomorrow morning, please email cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca with 2-3 lab sections that fit your course schedule no later than 12:00 PM PST on Friday, January 21. \nWait list students who have been moved into the course should email cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca ASAP to confirm exemptions for any lab(s) they missed while on the wait list.",
