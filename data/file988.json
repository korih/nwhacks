    "question": "I\u2019m wondering if we would have to change the signature on an exam given that some c.e.are giving false results. What if we were given c.e. that doesn\u2019t have a false result but the fn we write may produce one. I noticed this in the 2019 W1 Final where the solution fn could produce false but was not included in the c.e.\nAnother way to think about it is that a (listof x) already implies that the list could have a false. Would this be true for all lists? because that assumption would make sense.",
