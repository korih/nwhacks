    "title": "Use of abstraction in Q6 Problem Set 7",
    "question": "Are we allowed to use abstract functions or make a separate abstract function for functions that operate on mutual recursion for Q6? I ask this because I understand problem sets assess your understanding of concepts from weeks prior, but we only learned abstract this week.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Problem set 7 is not intended for use of abstract functions. \nI'm not sure I understand what you are asking exactly.\nAre you asking whether it is OK to convert the body of one of the functions in a multi-function template into a call to an abstract function?\nOr are you asking whether it is OK to write the contents of a 2-one-of-table cell (a cond answer) using an abstract function?\nIn general the answer to both questions is yes, but usually when we give you a multi-function template to work with we are expecting you not to replace the function bodies with calls to abstract functions?\nDid I understand your question properly?"
