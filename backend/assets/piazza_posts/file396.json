    "question": "I have been using my desktop computer to do all the coding for this class so far but it does not have a camera.\nWould it be possible to join zoom on my laptop but take the exam on my desktop? This would leave me unable to \"screen share\" but i would be able to turn my laptop around if you wanted to take a look at my desktop screens.",
    "student_answer": "\u201cYou may run Zoom on the same computer you are using to run Dr. Racket, or you may use another computer or a cell phone or a tablet that Zoom runs on acceptably.\u201d\n-@313",
