    "question": "Just wanted some clarification on the below statement:\nYou must pass the combined average of midterm 2 and the final exam to pass the course.\nDoes this mean you need to achieve a 22.5/45% (m2=20%, final=25%) to pass then?",
    "student_answer": "I believe the average of your midterm 2 and final grades should be at least 50%. So, if you get 40% on midterm 2, then you should get at least 60% on the final.",
