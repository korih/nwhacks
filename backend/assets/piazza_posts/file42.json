    "question": "Hi, I logged into my edX account and realized that I am still enrolled in a CPSC 110 course I dropped in 2021. I was wondering if I should just continue with that, or unenroll first and then perhaps reenroll some other way?",
    "student_answer": "In an earlier post it's mentioned that we don't get graded on edX work so I'd assume that it's fine to carry on",
    "instructor_answer": "You need to update to the new version of edX.  We are constantly updating the course content."
