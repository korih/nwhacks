Take home final Q1a what does it ask exactly?
"a merge-and-split element can be implemented by a sorting network"

I don't quite get it on the English level to be honest.Â 

So a merge-and-split element is a node of a merge-and-split network that take in 2 input lists and do sth(merge sorting in this case) to make sure merge-and-split network eventually output a sorted array right? it's a {N^L, N^L} -> N^2L function?

and a sorting network is just sort a sequence whatever how it's implemented,

Now isn't by definition the sorting network implemented the merge-and-split network??
