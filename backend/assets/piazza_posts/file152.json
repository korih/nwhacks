    "question": "Why is my check-expect not passing? \nAnd I see from the solution there isn't a test for the base case. How do I know when to include a base case or not?\n(check-expect (boxify empty-image) empty-image)\n\n(define (boxify i)\n  (overlay (rectangle (image-width i)\n                      (image-height i)\n                      \"outline\"\n                      \"black\")\n           i))",
    "student_answer": "(rectangle 0 0 \"outline\" \"black\")\nHey, this is very strange but apparently when you run this code it is NOT an empty image, there is a small dot produced, maybe that is why and it is a product of how racket deals with images?",
