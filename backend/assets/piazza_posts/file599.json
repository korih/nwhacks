    "question": "Please complete this survey if you require accommodation to write CPSC 110 Midterm 2 at an alternate time due to course conflicts, religious observations, or other extenuating circumstances. \n  Midterm 2 is scheduled in-person on Tuesday, March 15 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM PDT. The alternate exam will take place in-person the morning after the regularly scheduled exam, however, we will provide more details to students who are approved to write the alternate exam when this survey closes. \n  There are no labs the week of the midterm (March 14-18) so there is no need to complete this survey if your regularly scheduled lab conflicts with the midterm time.\n  Students registered through the Centre for Accessibility do not need to fill out this form to receive exam accommodations such as extended time. They should only complete this form if they cannot write the regularly scheduled exam due to one of the reasons above. If you have exam accommodations such as extended time, you must register for the exam through the CFA exam portal according to their specified deadline.\n  You must complete the survey before 5:00 PM PST on Tuesday, March 8.\n  https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0SZ2LPRlQMaS5Ui\n ",
