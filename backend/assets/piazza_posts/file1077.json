    "question": "UBC Campus Security has notified us that access to the exam room buildings will not be open until 15 minutes before the exam time (3:15 PM PDT). Please be patient if you arrive earlier to your exam room building and are unable to get in. The course team will let you in once we've placed the assigned seating cards in the exam rooms. If the start of the exam is delayed slightly, we will adjust the submission time accordingly. \nSee you all soon and best of luck!",
