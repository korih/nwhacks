    "question": "At what time, we need to use natural in the signature?\nIs 0 a natural number?",
    "student_answer": "You need to use Natural in the signature if the function takes natural. \nZero is natural to my understanding as it comes under counting the items (0 to infinite)\ncheck @441 for better understanding.\nJust to add: 0 is a Natural number to Dr Racket, but not in mathematics (so confusion is understandable).\n ",
