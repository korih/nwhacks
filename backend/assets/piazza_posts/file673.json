The first one is my code and the second is the solution code.\n  (@template 2-one-of)\n\n(define (concat los1 los2)\n  (cond [(empty? los1) los2]\n        [(empty? los2) los1]\n        [else (append los1 los2)]))\n\n(@template 2-one-of)\n\n(define (concat lsta lstb)\n  (cond [(empty? lstb) lsta] ;(1)\n        [(empty? lsta) lstb] ;(2)\n        [else                ;(3)\n         (cons (first lsta)\n               (concat (rest lsta) lstb))]))",

    "instructor_answer": "concat is our name for append, so no we don't want you to use append.  If you could use append you could just write the following! :)\n(define (concat a b) (append a b))\nOr for that matter you could write:\n(define concat append)"
