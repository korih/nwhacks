    "question": "Please complete this survey if you require accommodation to write CPSC 110 Midterm 1 at an alternate time due to course conflicts, religious observations, or other extenuating circumstances. \nMidterm 1 is scheduled online on Monday, February 7 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM PST. The alternate exam generally takes place the morning after the regularly scheduled exam, however, we will email students who are approved to write the alternate exam with the alternate time when this survey closes.\nStudents who have a CPSC 110 lab section that conflicts with the exam should not complete this survey. Please see @311 for instructions regarding make-up labs. Students registered through the Centre for Accessibility do not need to fill out this form to receive exam accommodations such as extended time. They should only complete this form if they cannot write the regularly scheduled exam due to one of the reasons above. If you have exam accommodations such as extended time, please email your accommodation letters to cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca if you have not done so already. \nYou must complete the survey before 5:00 PM PST on Friday, January 28.\nhttps://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3QMXAZepJPDMxpQ",
