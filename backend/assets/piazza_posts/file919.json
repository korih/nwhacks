    "title": "Midterm 2 problem 4 regrades",
    "question": "Sorry for the delay.  It's been a lot of a term for us too.\nMidterm 2 problem 4 has now been regraded with a new correct grader.  Good news is that no one's grade went down, and the average score went up by about 9 points.  The people who saw the largest positive change were people who had a correct function definition, but had been incorrectly deducted because of which built in abstract functions they used.\nWe know there are some concerns with problem 2, and Emily will post instructions shortly.",
