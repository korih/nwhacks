    "title": "Map vs Foldr",
    "question": "Hello,\nFor the foldr function, we are required to provide a base case to the function, however for map we do not have to. They both operate on lists (although foldr is adding creating a list) but why do we not have to provide a base case for map? How does it know it has finished it's recursion?",
    "student_answer": "The base case for the map is empty, as it produces a list. It will always be empty.\nThe foldr function outputs an arbitrary data type, which is why the base case must be defined.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
