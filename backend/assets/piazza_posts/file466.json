    "title": "Request for Possible TEXT-COLOUR Change?",
    "question": "Hi!\nThis might be a random request, but I was wondering if it is possible for future assignments/tests, not to pre-define TEXT-COLOUR as \"black\"? \nI like using Racket in dark mode because its easier on the eyes but I can never see the results, which requires me to change it before and after submitting lol.\nThank you if you do consider! :)",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "just change it from \"black\" to \"white\"\nWhen you are ready to submit your assignment, change the TEXT-COLOUR to its original state"
