    "student_answer": "I am still confusing after reading the announcement about grade scope, are we not looking at the antegrading report for p4 style rule(because that says 0/100)? Are we just looking at the main page of the grade scope for this particular one?",
    "instructor_answer": "Please re-read @477 more carefully, then re-read your report shown on Gradescope again."
