    "question": "Hi,\nJust want to clarify the lab problems for waitlisted student. I have already completed the first lab for this week but on the syllabus it did not say where to submit the lab or the deadline for submission for waitlist student. The only thing that we have to submit that is mentioned in waitlist criteria was the Pset1. Does that mean we just complete the lab for our learning but we do not need hand it in on SPD. If we do need hand in the lab, which section do we hand it in for on the SPD and when is the deadline for submission for waitlist student and the lab problem?\nThis is what is said on the syllabus:\nThanks",
    "student_answer": "What I gather from that paragraph from the syllabus is that waitlisted students should do the lab for experience but get a 0 on the actual lab. That\u2019s what I understand at least.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
