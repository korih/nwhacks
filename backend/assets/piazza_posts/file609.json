    "question": "Hi, in the code for fractals-starter there is the following signature:\n(@htdf stri)\n(@signature Number -> Image)\n;; produce a Sierpinski Triangle of the given size\nShouldn't Number be Natural in this case? I thought that triangle can only take positive numbers as an argument for side length. Thanks!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "In this problem you are designing a function to produce a Sierpinski triangle.  You aren't duplicating the signature for the triangle primitive."
