    "student_answer": "The short answer is that you\u2019re typically expected to run a test with an empty string when you have a function that takes a string. It\u2019s needed because some part of the autograder is specifically checking to make sure you test with an empty string.\nThe long answer is that the purpose of check-expect statements (and tests in general) is to test a wide variety of parameters to make sure your function won\u2019t fail. But because the functions we\u2019re writing deal with fairly simple parameters - there\u2019s not actually that many things you can test.\nSay you wrote a function that compares two numbers. You would want to have tests that check if they\u2019re equal, greater than, or less than. In your case here, you\u2019d want to test a string shorter than 5, longer than 5, and equal to 5. But empty strings are also a bit unusual, like how zero can be a bit unusual, so it\u2019s worth checking them.\n\u2800",
