    "instructor_answer": "@309 has a similar issue, FYI. It's likely you have an infinite loop. Notice that, if something's wrong with the recursive call in a recursive function, your function will just keep going in circles forever (or, in practice, until DrRacket hits the memory limit); make sure your recursive call is always working with a smaller \"amount\" of data each time. Hope this helps!"
