    "question": "i currently attend CPSC110 and VANT140D V03\nnow. I have a question about CPSC Vantage tutorial. When I checked on the\nalchemy website, I confirmed that the task was written by March 16. So, I\nwas going to finish all my assignments after Midterm yesterday, but as you\nknow, on Midterm, I couldn't access alchemy because the piazza was closed,\nso I tried to finish all my assignments today. However, when I went in and\nchecked now, it was indicated that there was no assignment. Is there a\nproblem? When I checked, it was confirmed that the date of submission of\nthe assignment was written as March 16th.",
