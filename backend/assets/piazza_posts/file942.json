    "question": "I cant seem to get the template tag right, when I write the tag for the given template should I use all types encapsulated?",
    "student_answer": "If you have an accumulator, encapsulated is redundant; also, check to see that you're including the data types you're using in the function i.e. fn for ???. Also, look at the autograder report: it specifies what you\u2019re lacking (though you\u2019ll have to interpret what it means).",
