    "question": "Hello,\n\nI don\u2019t know where else to ask this, but last semester I was enrolled in CPSC 110 and I ended up dropping it. SPD doesn\u2019t allow me to hand in Pset1 and says that my cwl is not accepted.\n\nIf any of the instructors know what I could do.\n\nThanks ",
    "student_answer": "Maybe check if your Computer Science Department account is still active? That might be the issue. Here's the link:\nhttps://www.cs.ubc.ca/getacct\nI'm not sure if you went through the set-up from the course syllabus, but there was a test file that was asked to be handed in to check that you're able to submit files via the SPD Hand-in. It might be a good idea to check if that works for you if you haven't done so already.",
