    "question": "Hi, I was blocked from registering for a lab section at first since I'm retaking this course (failed it last term), so I attended L2C for my first lab. I attended the lab and let my breakout room TA know my situation via a private message. I submitted the lab and got full marks on the autograder, but I left without being checked off by mistake (TA wasn't in the breakout room at the time). On the course syllabus, it says \"If you get 2/3 for your TA score, your lab grade will be capped at 80%\", so I'm wondering why I got a 0? I definitely attended the lab and behaved appropriately while I was there.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "As specified in the course syllabus, grading concerns should be directed to cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca. "
