    "question": "Hi!\nI'm not sure if this is allowed on piazza but I'm not quite sure where else to ask...\nI was wondering if anybody could provide a link to the discord server that was mentioned in the pinned piazza post?\nI would love to chat with classmates and would greatly appreciate an invite link or something of a similar sort!\nThanks!",
    "student_answer": "There is a discord server, but I don't think you should join the server. You can use Piazza to chat with classmates because the Discord server isn't being monitored by the staff and can lead to academic misconduct. I know this doesn't answer your question, but you'd be safer by not joining the server. In my case, I had to leave the server after reading the new pinned post because I didn't want to be involved in anything. Discord is fun, but I don't think it is worth all that trouble.",
