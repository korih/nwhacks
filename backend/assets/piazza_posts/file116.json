    "title": "Problem with test thoroughness for m01-htdf-starter problem 4",
    "question": "It keeps saying that I have one or more missing cases for test thoroughness for problem 4 (everything else works and I got my marks for those). It runs perfectly fine. I even double checked the solution to make sure I wasn't doing anything weird, and I have 2 more check-expects then the solution (for individual empty images) and it worked for both of those check-expects. I have the exact same function as the solution from the solution file, and I'm still missing a mark. I'm not sure what is going on.",
