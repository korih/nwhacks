    "question": "I just have a question:\nI finished my lab and submitted my autograder, got 100/100 and got the 3/3 TA check-in\nbut later, after the lab, doing some experimenting, and using the autograder, got 0/100.\nMy question is which submitted version does the Autograder grade? The most recent? Or the highest-socred? I am worried that I will be graded 0/100 because of this bad version I submitted.",
