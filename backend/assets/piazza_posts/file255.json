    "question": "Hi , so I am confirming that lecture I clicker grades are to be counted from today. But, I have a question that as mentioned by professor Gregor in a earlier post in piazza that our one week lowest grades of I clicker. So that will be applied now as 2 lecture grades will be excused when counting towards final lecture grade.So can anyone help me in this by clarifying my doubts about this thing.\n\nThanks ",
