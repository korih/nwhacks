I am quite confused about the additional commented-out template. Is it because we have 2 variables now? Another question is about the @htdf, @signature, and @template tags, which the solution did not include. Are the sample solutions the older version and are we supposed to include the necessary tags? ",
    "student_answer": "Always include the newer version with necessary tags in labs, problem sets, exams, etc.\nI believe the additional commented-out template is just an expanded version to \"show work\". Helpful in solutions when you don't get to watch a video with a voiceover of someone explaining their logic over it.",
