    "question": "I was planning on registering for CPSC 121 over the summer. There are two options for classes and one is restricted to students in VC-BSC. Does this mean Vancouver Bachelor of Science students? If so, does this mean I can register for it as a first-year if my program is BSC and I am in Vancouver?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "VC-BSC means Vantage College. If you are not in Vantage College you cannot register for a section restricted to VC-BSC."
