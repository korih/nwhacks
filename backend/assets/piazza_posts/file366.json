I included three check-expects in total, base case, a list with one egg, and a list with 2 eggs\n0.8%  of   1.6%  x     Test thoroughness (known fault detection): incorrect - failed to detect known likely faults.\n                         Test thoroughness (known fault detection):             failed to detect fault 1.\nplace-egg:  I included two check-expects, the first one with place-egg's arguments as an egg and a circle image, and the other with an egg (different x y r values) and MTS\n0%  of   2.2%  x       Test thoroughness (known fault detection): incorrect - failed to detect known likely faults.\n                           Test thoroughness (known fault detection):             failed to detect fault 1.",
