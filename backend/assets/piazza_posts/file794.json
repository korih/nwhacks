    "question": "I have finished the early release questions but am unsure of the last one as I don't remember the term lifting being used in the course. Perhaps I am just being forgetful. Anyways, here is what I got as an answer:\nCan someone explain the exact definition of a lifted function or the module that goes over it in EdX? Is my solution correct?\n(define (fn_0 x) (build-list 3 (lambda (y) (+ y x (first (list 4 6 0 1)))))) \n \n(define (fn_0 x) (build-list 2 (lambda (y) (+ y x (first (list 6 0 1)))))) \n\n(define (fn_0 x) (build-list 1 (lambda (y) (+ y x (first (list0 0 1)))))) \n\n(define (fn_0 x) (build-list 0 (lambda (y) (+ y x (first (list 1)))))) ",
