    "question": "Did anyone update Windows OS lately (March-22 update) and survived to tell? My computer screams for an update and runs slowly, but I don't want to update just before the final. ",
    "student_answer": "Regardless of whether or not others\u2019 computers update successfully without issue, it\u2019s difficult to say whether yours will or not. I\u2019d hold off until after the final just in case\u2026 we\u2019re on the home stretch, and wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen.\nThe macOS fiasco right before midterm 2 serves as a warning! Some had issues, some didn\u2019t.",
