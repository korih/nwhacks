    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Abstract functions are guaranteed to handle the base case, so we don't need to test for it in these scenarios! :)\nIt's the same for when you have a function that's templated off of use-abstract-fn, you don't need to test for the base case either!"
