    "title": "Updating your operating system - DON'T",
    "question": "A couple of people reported problems updating their Mac to 15.4.\nIn general the day before / day of an exam is not a good time to update your operating system.  I usually don't do updates except security issues during the term.  So if you haven't already updated then don't.\nIf you have updated try downloading a new version of Dr Racket and see if that helps.  Also be sure that after the update you are starting DrRacket and not racket.",
