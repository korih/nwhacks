    "question": " I don't understand how identity works when we use abstract functions, for example:\n\n(build-list n identity), why does it produce (0 1 . . . n-1 )?",
    "student_answer": "Identity just outputs whatever came in. The reason we have this is because abstract functions like build-list require a function in order to work (of which it will apply to each of the elements of the list), but in some instances we don't want a function that changes anything. For example:\n(identity 1) ; outputs 1\n(identity \"hello\") ; outputs \"hello\"",
