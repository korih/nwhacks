    "question": "Hi, \nI was just trying to redo the midterm problem, aren't they auto-graded so we can get back feedback from them instead of looking at the solutions?",
    "student_answer": "yeah you go to gradescope and click on the individual questions to look at the autograder comments",
    "instructor_answer": "We haven't typically allowed re-submissions to closed assignments, but now that the autograding reports are getting more useful we are getting more requests for that.  Let me take a look at what it would take to allow submissions to re-open after the deadline."
