    "question": "Hello.\n\nI was wondering if running a program successfully without any error would guarantee that we also pass the syntax check? Thank you!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Yes.  Check syntax is the first thing DrRacket does as part of running a program.  So if it runs it also checks syntax.\nIf it runs WITH NO \"RED ERRORS\" - error messages in red - then the autograder should be able to do at least partial grading."
