    "title": "Problem with Edx lecture starters",
    "question": "I logged on to Edx recently, and when I tried to access the lecture starters, every one ends up giving me this error:\nI have tried the following without any success:\n-Logging in and out again\n-Restarting my computer\n-Making sure I am not logged in on two computers at the same time\nIs there any resolution for this problem? It would be really helpful to access the starters in order to practice for the final. ",
    "student_answer": "Try clearing your cookies maybe? I just checked EdX myself and everything was there and I could download starter files too so it doesn't seem to be a problem with the site.\nAlternatively, you could also try downloading the starters on your phone or something, uploading to google drive or something, and downloading it to your computer. Very roundabout way of doing it but better than no starter files right? \nGood luck tho OP that sucks :(",
    "instructor_answer": "Clearing cache / cookies should be your best bet. I\u2019ve had my fair share of Edx issues as well and clearing cache / cookies solved most of them. Anon. Gear, were you able to solve this issue?"
