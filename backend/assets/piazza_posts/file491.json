    "question": "in data definition part(htdd), how many examples are needed for a BST?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Remember that the data definition examples serve to explain the data definition.  You *might* also use them in tests, but that's much less important.\nSo just a few examples is probably enough to explain the BST data definition. Maybe even just two or even just one."
