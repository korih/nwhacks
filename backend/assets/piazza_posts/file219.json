    "question": "Is there any way to get iClicker to be less delayed? For example, I chose C initially within a 30-second lecture question, and within the last 10 seconds, I clicked A and it didn't change. It just stayed frozen until the submission. The same was true for another question. Can I not change my answer when I click it? I know it is over now, but if this recurs for every lecture, I am concerned that it will impact my lecture grade. Is the \"No changing answers\" issue due to my phone, or have others had this issue? I'm trying to avoid getting multiple wrongs because I quickly chose an answer and then changed my mind.",
