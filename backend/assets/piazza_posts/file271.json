    "question": "Hello,\nI am not sure what to do since I have been trying to get into a lab section since this course began. I have emailed CPSC undergrad and they said they were going to add me over a week ago but I still haven't heard back. I have sent a follow up email yesterday as well. \nAny advice is appreciated as I have done everything on my part to get into the desired lab section.\nThanks",
