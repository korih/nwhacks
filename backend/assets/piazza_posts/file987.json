    "title": "Maze problem - right and down",
    "question": "After reading the question @976 I wondered if we could treat the maze, where we can only go right or down, as a Binary tree rather than an arbitrary-arity tree? \nI tried to solve it using the binary tree template, but didn't make it run (unfortunately, it doesn't mean that it is impossible) ",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Yes, that could be a binary tree.  But for the general maze a position has [0, 4] possible next positions, so we chose to use a genrec arb-tree approach from the beginning."
