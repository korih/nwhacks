    "question": "Do we still include the try-catch @template tag when we have search/find functions with accumulators? I noticed that the find-path-tr solution didn't have try-catch. Do we not use try-catch when it is tail-recursive?",
    "student_answer": "If we drop (if (not (false? \u2026))) then we drop the try-catch template.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
