    "question": "My problem set partner and I are a bit at odds over the interpretation of the course-dependents part of the Course compound structure. My interpretation was that it is asking for the courses that need the given course as a pre-req and his was that it's the pre-reqs required for the given course.  Any clarity would be much appreciated!",
    "student_answer": "It should become clear what it means when you read that part about C110 including C313 and C317 twice.\nAlso, the define-struct name given to the ListOfCourse is \"dependents\".",
