    "question": "Hi,\nSince TA's told we could submit lab till end of day so are there some fixed number of attempts for this?\nAlso, some of the answers I submitted are correct but have not received the grade?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "There's a cool-down for when you can resubmit to receive a full report. It says at the top of the last autograder report you submitted.\nYou can resubmit it as much as you'd like, but remember that we'd like students to learn to be able to defend their code and be confident with it."
