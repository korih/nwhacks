All of my tests pass, but since I'm not confident if this is truly an alternative solution, would it be possible for anyone to check?\nMy apologies for having to make everyone read through the code.

    "student_answer": "There is a bit of redundancy in your code in\n(and (even? (first lon)) (> skips 0))\nBecause the numbers are natural, they are either odd or even, so everything (odd? (first lon)) produced false for is even. ",
