    "question": "This question asks for a fn-composition of exactly 2 different build-in abstract functions. If I were to use length in addition to two built-in abstract functions. Would it be wrong? (since it would be a fn-composition of technically 3 functions(?))\n\nFor example: ( I know map is redundant in this case, just as an example)\n\n(define (count-duplicates los1 los2)\n(local [(define (count x)\n1)\n(define (in-both? x)\n(ormap\n(lambda (i) (string=? x i)) los2))]\n(length (map count (filter in-both? los1)))))",
