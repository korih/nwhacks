    "question": "What does reverse usually do in the code? I saw many in the past practice finals.",
    "student_answer": "From my understanding, \nits used to reverse a list and have it show the other way around. \nfor example, if you have a path accumulator and you want to produce the path to a node, creating a list will get you that path. But, there are two ways of creating that path and it depends on what the problem is asking. You can either append two lists or you can cons a node onto the path. \n(cons node path) gives you (list C B A)\n(append (list A) (list B) (list C)) gives you (list A B C) \nif you do the first option but it asks you for the path from start to finish you would need to reverse the list to get the right answer.
