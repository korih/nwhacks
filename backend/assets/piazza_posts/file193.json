    "title": "would it be correct to say functions are non-primitive operators?",
    "question": "",
    "student_answer": "\u2800",
    "instructor_answer": "This language doesn't really have operators in the sense that many other languages do.  Calling an operator and calling a user defined function always look the same, so for example\n(my-function (* 2 3))  ;the call to my-function follows the same rules as the call to *\n\n\nmyFunction(2 * 3)      // the call to myFunction has one set of rules, the operator * has another\nThis uniformity of calling rules is another advantage of the simple BSL language."
