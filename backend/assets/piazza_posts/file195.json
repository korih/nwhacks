    "question": "Hi,\nWhen I submit my problem set I get \"1.3%  of     4%  x      Signature: incorrect.\" for problem 6. Not sure how that is possible, since the signature is according to htdf design and style rules on edx.\nCan someone please explain to me what I might be doing wrong?",
    "student_answer": "It seems like your signature is partially correct so I would say it's probably best to reread the question carefully and think of what the input and output of the function is supposed to be. \u2800",
