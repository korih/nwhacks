    "student_answer": "I think they might adjust the weighting based on how well the class did on that question, and that's probably the only way they'll scale the finals. \nJust like the midterm two they lower the weight of question 4 because most of the people does not do good on it. ",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
