    "question": "Hi, \nI can't seem to figure out problem 6 of pset11. I know we have to check which route has the minimum duration, but I'm not sure how we can check that. I tried a dry run of the check expect with TH as from and TI as to... but can't figure out how to get 4 instead of 6. I'm also referring to my solution for problem 5 for this as they are very similar but still can't figure it out.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
