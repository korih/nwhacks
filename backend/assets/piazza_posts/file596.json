    "question": "I got a 100 on my autograder for problem set 5 and had short TA grading where I was asked one question which i answered correctly.\n\nI still got a 73.68 as my grade\n\nIsn't short TA grading worth 25%? I still ended up getting less than a 75 even though i answered the question correctly and got a 100 on my autograder.\n\nWas there a mistake in the grading?",
