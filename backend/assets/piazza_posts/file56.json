    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Edx keeps magically deleting questions when we restart the course.  Friday they finally gave us a theory about how and why this happens, but it was too late for this term.\nSo they are NOT supposed to be missing.  But we do know they are missing.  Apologies."
