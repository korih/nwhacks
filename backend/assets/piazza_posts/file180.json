    "question": "Hi, for question 1 and all other questions on problem sets, should we just write a single expression which produces the correct answer, or should we evaluate the expression step by step showing every step until we arrive at the final answer?",
    "student_answer": "The questions which want you to list down every step clearly say that they want you to, so if it doesn't explicitly ask you to list them out you should be fine writing just the required code.",
