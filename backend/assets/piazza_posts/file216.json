    "question": "Can somebody please tell me what function to use to do something like this: *check if the input is a string, if it is, move to the next condition* \n\nI've tried using (string? (<my condition>)) but I get an error saying \"string=?: expects a string, given <a number>\", meaning that the function didn't skip over that condition...\nThanks!",
    "student_answer": "Careful that \n(string=? x y)\nand\n(string? x)\nare different. For instance, the first consumes 2 arguments and the second only consumes 1 (I'd search them up on Racket help desk if you still need more info)",
