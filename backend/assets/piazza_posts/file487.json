    "title": "Unable to Attend Office Hours for MT1 Support",
    "question": "I wanted to talk with an instructor about MT1 and how I can set up a plan to fill in my gaps of understanding. I wasn't able to attend today's office hours because of other classes and tomorrow I won't be able to either because of my lab that perfectly runs during the instructor's office hours. Is there another option to get into contact with an instructor for \"post-midterm guidance?\" ",
    "student_answer": "For post-midterm guidance, you can also see a TA! Since there\u2019s a lot of them there should be at least one office hour that fits in your schedule :)",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
