    "title": "Cond. Expressions: Else",
    "question": "So cond. expressions are formatted with several cases of [<question> <answer>].\n1) Does the answer always have to be a value? Or is it ever allowed to type an expression instead? (like a boolean, or etc.)\n2) Likewise, for the \"else\" case, does that answer always have to be a value?",
    "student_answer": "In cond case, the answer could be a value (number, string) or a boolean as well depending upon the case.\nIn the example of GradeStanding the cond answer was a boolean.\n\n(define (grades? x)\n(cond [(number? x) (>= 90)]\n[(string=? x \"H\") \"H\"]\n\nFor more details check @244.",
    "instructor_answer": "Also check out @285 - Very similar questions and the answer there can be extrapolated to non-boolean types."
