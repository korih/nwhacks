    "question": "It was extremely uncomfortable to write the exam in IRC 2. I found I had very little room to work with all of: laptop, checklist booklet, and the problem 2&3 example sheet. I sat near the top, and at one point, a TA/invigilator was swinging their arms back and forth behind me while supervising, which was incredibly distracting. Compared to the room assignments of LIFE 2201 and ANGU 098, which have solid desks, arm room, leg room, and plenty of space to put all of your materials, it felt borderline unfair to have to write the same exam under such different conditions.\nI apologize if I come off as pretentious, and I'm not even sure if room assignments are controllable by faculty, but I was wondering if the next exam could be written in similar rooms by all students within the course.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you were uncomfortable writing the exam. Unfortunately faculty and course staff have very little control over room assignments for exams - they are booked by scheduling services. We can request specific rooms based on the size/format of the exam, but those requests are rarely accommodated given that there are often multiple exams across different courses, programs, and faculties held on a daily basis. We did not request IRC 2 for this exam, but I will notify scheduling services that IRC 2 is not a suitable room for CPSC 110 exams in future terms. "
