    "question": "Hii, I am already registered to one of the lectures in this course and one of the labs, do I still need to give the waitlist quiz which is taking place today?\nThanks in advance!",
    "student_answer": "No! The waitlist quiz is specifically for those who are waitlisted to ensure they are keeping up with the content. So that when they get off the waitlist and become registered for the course, they won't be behind on the course material.",
