    "title": "SPD handin questions",
    "question": "When we submit our problem sets/Labs using the SPD handin button, and if we get a \"handin successful\" message, and an autograder email.\nI have a few questtions to confirm my understanding:\nfirst: is that it? just confirming, there are NO other steps to handing in assignments, right?\nsecond: is there any way we can truly verify our submission has been successful, and view our submissions?\nThird: the submission being graded will be the most recent submission, correct, right?\nFourth: for both labs and assignments, we can submit as many times as we want to check our work, the only caveat being a increasing cooldown period to receive detailed feedback as the term progresses, right?\nthanks.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Well setup questions.  Here you go:\n- No other steps.\n- If it says handin successful it was submitted.\n- You will get one grading report email per submission; your grade will be based on the last submission.\n- Yes."
