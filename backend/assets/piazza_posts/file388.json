    "question": "Let's say I get covid, it sounds like I can stay home and use iclicker reef to do the iclicker questions? Then I can watch the provided lectures from last term, for a lecture or two. \nYes/no?\nThanks for your time.",
    "student_answer": "Technically, yes but ideally you should know what\u2019s going on in lecture to be able to answer the questions properly.",
    "instructor_answer": "We will post a comprehensive message, but iClicker questions will not be available outside the lecture rooms.\nIf you have to miss more than one or two lectures you will have to communicate that to cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca, with documentation supporting that, and you will be excused from those clicker questions."
