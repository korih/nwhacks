    "question": "Hi, I was wondering if we will be expected to memorize all the built in functions from the language page on EdX?",
    "student_answer": "I believe so, since they will not be on the design recipes sheet they give us.",
    "instructor_answer": "The student answer is exactly write.  We haven't found that to be a problem, since once one does the work to understand the functions and how to use them their names are quite natural."
