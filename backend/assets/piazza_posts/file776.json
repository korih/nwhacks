    "question": "For the encapsulate-total-area problem (under Locals Problem Blank), why wouldn't the template tag be:\n(@template Dir ListOfDir ListOfImage Image encapsulated)\ninstead of \n(@template Dir ListOfDir ListOfImage encapsulated)\nsince we encapsulated a function (image-area) that used (@template Image) tag. Is it because image-area is a helper function?",
