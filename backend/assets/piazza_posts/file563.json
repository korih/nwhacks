    "question": "Hi, I took my first few days of reading break off only to realize now that I completely missed my problem set 6. I never thought about it being due in the middle of reading break, but I realize that it's my fault for not checking to be sure. The only thing I checked before logging off for the weekend was my canvas homepage, as all of my other courses post deadlines on there. I know one request isn't going to change the way the course works, but would it be possible to add any deadlines as a canvas notification as well? Thanks",
