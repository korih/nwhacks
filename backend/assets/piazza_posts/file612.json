    "question": "The syllabus says that You must pass the lab component to pass the course. I was wondering whether the pass grade for the lab component is overall 50% and how it is calculated. Could you please give some further explanations? Thanks for your answering.",
    "student_answer": "Most courses at UBC require at least 50% to pass unless it's otherwise specified by the course (meaning that the pass grade for the lab component is 50% or greater).",
    "instructor_answer": "The average of all your lab grades (excluding your lowest lab grade that is dropped and any exemptions) must be >= 50%. "
