    "question": "Hi there,\nI am currently registered in the waitlist for 110 while also registered in 107 in case I do not get a spot in 110. \nI noticed that my autograder cooldown for problem set 1 is the same between both classes (I am unable to see feedback for the 110 pset1 right after submitting pset1 for 107).\nWhile I do not mind waiting for the cooldown, I am concerned whether my pset1 for 107 will somehow interfere/ replace my pset1 for 110 or vice versa.\nCould someone look into this for me?\nThank you ",
