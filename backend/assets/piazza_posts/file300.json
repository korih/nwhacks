    "question": "Hi,\n\nI don\u2019t know where else to put this but I checked canvas and I got zero for my first and second lab. I haven\u2019t been added to a lab section yet so I\u2019ve been doing the labs on my own. I thought these labs would be omitted but I got a zero on them?? I am really freaking out right now because I also got a 75 on pset one. I did everything in my own time with the autograder giving me 100 on everything. I\u2019ve also been trying to get into a lab section for three weeks now, and even emailed for a follow up update but I haven\u2019t heard a single thing yet about being added to labs. I did what I was supposed to stand at 25%???",
