    "question": "Please read this message about regrade requests VERY CAREFULLY. Any regrade request that does not comply with this note will be denied without a written reply.\n  Regrade requests will be open from 5:00 PM PST on Monday, February 14 to 5:00 PM PST on Thursday, February 17. We will not accept regrade requests outside of this window. \n  You must submit your request through Gradescope. A regrade request is only appropriate if your exam was mis-graded according to the rubric. Your request needs to explain clearly how your answer is correct according to the rubric. In order to do that you should read the rubric on Gradescope carefully, read the posted solution carefully, and read your exam carefully. If, after doing that, you can clearly explain why your answer is correct according to the rubric then please do submit a regrade request.\n  Please note that:\nA regrade request is not an opportunity for you to explain why you answered the way you did.\nA regrade request is not an opportunity to ask us to explain why your answer is incorrect.\nA regrade request is not appropriate if you disagree with the rubric, dislike the rubric, or otherwise think the rubric unfair.\nWe reserve the right to regrade your full exam, not only the problem for which you are requesting a regrade.\nAgain, a regrade request is an opportunity to point out that your exam was mis-graded according to the rubric. Any other regrade request will not receive a reply.",
