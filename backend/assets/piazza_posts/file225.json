    "question": "I am a student on the waitlist. I finished my lab 1 but I did not spdhandin, instead I asked the TA to check it over on Monday. I read that students on the waitlist have the labs they could not attend excused. Does that mean only the TA portion is excused or the whole lab? I was under the impression that the whole thing is removed and we are only doing the labs to learn the material.",
    "student_answer": "I believe the entire lab is excused.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
