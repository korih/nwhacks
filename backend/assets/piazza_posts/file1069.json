    "instructor_answer": "Please review @817 Midterm 2 Grades and Information carefully - Problem 5 was graded twice and appears in Gradescope twice. \u201cMT2 - P5\u201d is the autograding of almost all the problem. For this part you should ignore the gradescope score and focus on the autograder report. \u201cMT2 - P5ta\u201d is the hand grading of the termination argument. For this part you should ignore the autograding report and focus only on the Gradescope rubric.   "
