    "question": "for some reason, dr racket is taking a very long time to run through my code. i submitted it to the autograder and the problem set was able to be graded, so i don't think its a problem with the code. any troubleshooting advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

    "instructor_answer": "My first suggestion is to try commenting out 1/2 of the tests and then run it. If you still have the problem then comment out 1/2 of the remaining tests, if the problem is gone uncomment 1/2 the tests. \n\nProceeding that way you should be able to get a single test with the problem fairly quickly. \n\nThen you can use the stepper to see what is going on.
