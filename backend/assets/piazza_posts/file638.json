    "question": "I am almost getting my check-expects right, but for some, I get this error:\n\"rest: expects a non-empty list; given: empty\"\nI have tried different solutions for this problem but each failed. I am stuck on this one and don't know how to approach it differently. \nCan someone please help me?",
    "student_answer": "It might be a good idea to comment out every single test except for the one that's failing and to run the stepper on the check-expect to see what's going on.",
