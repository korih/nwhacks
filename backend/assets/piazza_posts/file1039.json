    "title": "Defer Final exam",
    "question": "I don't know what to do because it's my first time doing this. I have a very bad cold, and I have a fever and a strong headache, so I don't think I can take the final exam. Can I defer the final exam until later? I tested negative more than three times with a COVID-19 self-kit because I was suspected of COVID-19, but I am planning to go to the hospital tomorrow because of suspected symptoms. I can get a Doctor Note if necessary, but I tried my best to take the test on Sunday, but I can't take the test because of my physical condition, and I think it will hurt other students.",
    "student_answer": "Maybe try emailing the course coordinator (cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca) about this. Get well soon!\nAlso, check out this: https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/exams/standing-deferred-supplemental-exams ",
