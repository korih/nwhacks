    "question": "I am student added into cs110 from waitlist few days ago. I don't know how does the online lab operate at all. I join in the zoom meeting in the given time by the zoom links on canvas and see nobody is here.\nIs the lab purely online by ourselves or in another form?\nAnd one another question. Is there any deadline for the lab? I just realized that I forget to do my first lab.",
    "student_answer": "I believe wait-listed students are exempt from the first lab. \nDuring the labs, you must access the EDX course, under the \"Labs\" tab and download the starter files from there and complete them. And these labs must be completed during the 3 hour period, and you must be checked-off by a TA before you can leave.\nNot sure how the other labs are operating, but generally the TAs will split the class in half, or thirds (depending on how many TAs there are), and everyone will join the break-out room specified by the TA. The main room (the one you are automatically in when you join) will be empty. There should be a button to see the breakout rooms in the zoom itself.",
    "instructor_answer": "No students have been added to the course since before January 10th.  So everyone in the course now has been there from the start, and the rules outlined in the Syllabus apply.\nStudents currently on the waitlist took the waitlist quiz last night, and will hear about whether they will be moved into the course shortly."
