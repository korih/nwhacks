    "question": "The score of iClicker is determined by correctness or just participation?\nFor example, if I did all four iClicker questions during class, but one of them is wrong. How many scores did I get?\n75% determined by correctness? or 100% determined by just participation?",
    "student_answer": "To my knowledge, you got 1 mark for participation or attendance and the rest are correctness-based. So, according to what you have described, one incorrect would produce a total score of 4/5, if combined with the attendance marks.\nAlso, the syllabus is your best bet for information.",
