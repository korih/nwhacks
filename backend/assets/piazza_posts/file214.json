    "question": "Hi,\nI was wondering if somebody could explain the types of Atomic Data (ie: Simple Atomic) and what Interval means as well? I was doing the questions in EDX and would like some clarification.\nI know that Atomic Data cannot be broken down into smaller pieces, but I am unsure of what an interval would mean other than seeing it in a video shown like this: [0, 10].\nThanks!",

    "instructor_answer": "One thing we know about learning is that someone re-explaining something that is already covered in several forms isn't a good way to clarify understanding.\nInstead it turns out that if you form more focused questions, saying things like \"I understand this means ..., and that means ...; but what happens when...\", then the answers to those questions help more with learning.  What's really going on is that the work you do forming the questions itself produces learning.\nWith that in mind, please edit and update your question about to be more specific, to say what you do and don't understand in more detail and then we will be happy to answer it, and you will get a lot more out of it."
