    "question": "I was wondering if in the template for this function I need only use-abstract-fn or i need fn-composition, too? I can't differentiate when do I need fn-composition because sometimes it's not necessary\n(define (sum-to n)\n  (foldr + 0 (build-list (sub1 n) add1)))",
    "student_answer": "You need fn-composition as well, since a function takes the output of another function as one of its inputs.\nBe careful not to mistake DrRacket primitives for build-in abstract functions though.\n\nThese below are function compositions:\n(define (sum-to n)\n  (foldr + 0 (build-list (sub1 n) add1)))\n\n(define (fn1 n)\n (fn2 (fn3 n))\nThis below is NOT a function composition:\n(define (fn1 n)\n (fn2 (add1 n))",
