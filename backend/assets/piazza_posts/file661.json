    "question": "I have a question about midterm 2 range. \nWhen I looked at midterm instructions, it says \"Midterm 2 will cover all material up to and including the genrec module (all material means EdX numbered section videos, lecture, lecture notes, problem sets, labs, etc.).\" Yeah, I just want to know specific range of midterm 2. It will be covered until week 8 (abstraction) or week 9a (Generative recursion) ? \nThanks!",
