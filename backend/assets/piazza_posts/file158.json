    "question": "As I am going through this problem set I stated using constant definitions to make it less redundant, especially with the m0-starter file with the two images, but I notice that although it passes the spdHandin with 100 percent, it does not really follow the htdf steps since I am adding a constant definition; therefore, I am asking if it is wrong to do this or I should not be doing this until later ",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "It isn't really time to even start problem set 2 yet , and I can't find a pset-02 handin from you.  So I'm not really sure what you are referring to exactly."
