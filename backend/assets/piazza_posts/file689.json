    "question": "Wednesday this week I accidentally released the draft of the midterm 2 exam.  It was posted for about 6 hours and at least one student downloaded it, possibly more.  (I'm saying I rather than we because the other course staff are entirely innocent - this mistake is entirely on me!)\nWednesday night and since then has been pretty busy, as we have worked to develop an entirely new exam.  We will continue to work on that through the weekend.\nJust to ensure there is no possible lack of fairness from only some people seeing that draft exam, this message has copies of all the files that were accidentally made available.  No autograder will be available for these files, and no solutions will be posted.  But you may find it useful to work with these files and ask questions in office hours.\nmt2-p1-figure.pdf\nmt2-p1-starter.rkt\nmt2-p2-starter.rkt\nmt2-p3-starter.rkt\nmt2-p4-starter.rkt\nmt2-p5-starter.rkt\nmt2-p6-starter.rkt",
