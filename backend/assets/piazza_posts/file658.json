    "question": "Where is the survey we fill out if our computer cannot last the 2 hours of midterm 2?",
    "student_answer": "\u201cIf you do not have a computer to write the exam or you know that your computer cannot make it the full 2 hours even with a full battery, email the course coordinator at cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca no later than 5:00 PM PST on Tuesday, March 8.\u201d - from @600. You had to email them but unfortunately the deadline already passed :(\nAdding on, I think that there was discussion on Piazza some time ago where they would have given you accommodations for your computer... It's still worth emailing them to see what can be done.\nPlease do update this Piazza post if you hear back. ",
