    "instructor_answer": "I'm a little unsure how to help you.  The problem bank problem htdf P9 asks for a single function of four arguments called distance.  What you are showing above is one part of the design for that function, and then a couple other fragments of something else I'm not sure about.\nCould you put your complete design above and then we can help.  Also please use the {;} button in the post editor to make a code block, and then paste your complete design into that."
