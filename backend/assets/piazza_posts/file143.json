    "question": "This involves the Edx practice examples involving \"pointing on a picture\" where you need to click on a certain part of a program with a little green circle. When I click lower in the image, the green circle does not focus on where I want to click to the point where some examples are unanswerable because I can't click in the right area. Is anyone else having this issue? And is there a way I can fix it so that I can click accurately?",
