    "question": "I noticed that we won't be allowed to use the helpdesk for this midterm. I was wondering if we are expected to be familiar with the order to feed arguments to built-in racket functions that we've seen before in lectures. For instance with the \"place-image\" should we prepare to remember that the order to feed the arguments is: \n(place-image image x y scene)\nor would information like this generally be provided on midterms?\n[Edit]: @407 found it",
