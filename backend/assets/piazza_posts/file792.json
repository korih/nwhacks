    "title": "Correct Variables For Signatures of Abstract Functions",
    "question": "We were taught to go from X -> Y -> Z, but for more complex problems that require more than 3 variables in the signature, what convention for choosing variables would we use?\n\nI chose to go from before X so that my variables would end in Z, is this allowed?",
    "student_answer": "pls @6\n(did you not see the past 3 get snipped)",
    "instructor_answer": "The order doesn't really matter.  I usually go X Y Z U V W, because in examples with only 3 you tend to see X Y Z.  But it doesn't really matter."
