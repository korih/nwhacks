    "title": "Reworking of the skipn example-counting up",
    "question": "I was working though the sample skipn problem before tail accumulators, and I worked out the example of essentially the same problem but instead of our accumulator counting down once its passed our input n, it counts up from zero, marking the number of steps taken since its last skipped an element. So pretty similar. \nI got the function to run, but I had to use two if statement in my else case, and I'm wondering if there would be a more succinct version of writing this? I couldn't figure out how to run it without including a case for if the accumulator would be equal to 0, the input n, or another number. \nI'll include my function for clarity: \n(@htdf countup)\n(@signature (listof X) Natural -> (listof X))\n;; produce a list of pattern include first element, skipping the next n elements\n\n(check-expect (countup (list \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\") 2) (list \"a\" \"d\"))\n(check-expect (countup (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) 3) (list 1 5))\n\n;(define (skipu lox n) empty)\n\n(define (countup lox0 n)\n;; (skipu (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) 3)\n\n;; (skipu (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) 0)\n;; (skipu (list 1   3 4 5 6) 1)\n;; (skipu (list 1     4 5 6) 2)\n;; (skipu (list 1       5 6) 0)\n;; (skipu (list 1       5  ) 1)\n  (local [(define (countup lox acc)\n            (cond [(empty? lox) empty]\n                  [else\n                   (if (zero? acc)\n                       (cons (first lox)\n                             (countup (rest lox)\n                                   (add1 acc)))\n                       (if (= n acc) \n                       (countup (rest lox)\n                               0)\n                       (countup (rest lox)\n                                (add1 acc))))]))]\n    \n    (countup lox0 0)))\n                     ",
