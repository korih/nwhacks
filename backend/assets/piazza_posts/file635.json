    "question": "I have been having trouble running tests on dr racket. I have tried commenting out half of the file and running the tests again, it didn't work for me. When I try to submit the file, it says my handin is successful but I did not receive the autograder report in my email. Can someone help me with this issue?",

    "instructor_answer": "When you say \"commenting out half of the file and running the tests again, it didn't work for me\" can you say more about what you mean.  For example.\nI started with 16 tests. I commented out half the tests and then the tests still didn't run.\nSo I commented out half the remaining tests, and the tests still didn't run.\nAnd so on.  We are going to need a lot more information to help you.  \nAlso see @628"
