    "title": "2020w1-mt2 question about problem description",
    "question": "Hello, I was working through problem 3 where we are to complete the function design with the following purpose:\n;; produce true if list is a descending sequence starting at n, ending at 1\nI submitted the following test for which I received the autograder feedback below:\n(check-expect (descending-from-n? empty 0) false)\n\nTest validity (matches problem statement):             test number 1 invalid.\nI'm confused why this would be, since an empty list is not starting at 0 and there is nothing I've identified in the problem description as saying the given natural has to be greater than 0. Am I missing something else?\nThanks!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "In our interpretation of that problem the recursion looks like:\n(list 3 2 1)   3\n(list   2 1)   2\n(list     1)   2\n(list      )   0\nso we produce empty for the case you mention"
