    "question": "(@template MouseEvent)\n\n(define (lay-egg loe x y me)\n  (cond [(mouse=? me \"button-down\") (cons (make-egg x y 0) loe)]\n        [else loe]))\nAbove is the solution for raining eggs. I was wondering why Egg is not included in the template when the first cond case uses components of Egg?",
    "student_answer": "KeyEvent and MouseEvent take priority in the template. An @template tag can only have\n1\ndatatype and the more important one is KeyEvent/MouseEvent.",
