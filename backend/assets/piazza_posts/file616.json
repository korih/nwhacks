    "title": "Canvas grade different to autograder",
    "question": "I received 100  on autograder for pset 4, however, my grade in canvas shows a 75. Is this due to an autograder change or grading error?",
    "student_answer": "I believe this would be because a portion of your problem set grade is from TA assessment (25% if its short assessment, 50% if it is long) in your lab, and the canvas grade shows the overall mark, not just the autograder score.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
