    "title": "Designing template tag for htdf",
    "question": "If we are designing the @template tag for htdf, and we don't have a fata definition, and our signature is:\n\n(@signature String Number -> String)\n\nThen how would our @template tag look?\nHow do we know what to put in the @template tag?",
    "student_answer": "Usually, I just use the first consumed datatype in the signature. \nThe template function for String and Number aren't going to be different because they're both atomic-non-distinct.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
