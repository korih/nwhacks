    "question": "After reviewing the syllabus, as recommended in previous posts, I was unable to find a clear answer to what should happen besides request (and wait) to be placed into a section. If we missed a lab this week due to space issues, do we receive a 0% or is it omitted? Of course we should complete it for our learning, but I think its unclear on how the assessment for the missed lab will run, especially since I was told by the CPSC undergrad office to wait until I was placed into a viable section.\nThank you for any information you can provide.\nEdit: yes I have read @6, but it seems like this is common, consistent question.",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "I believe this is the relevant section of the Syllabus.  I believe this addresses your question, but if there's a specific point here that is unclear let us know and we can try to improve the text.\nI'm registered in a lecture section, but all the lab sections that fit my course schedule are full. What should I do?\nClosely monitor the SSC website to see if space opens up in the lab section you want. Up to the add/drop deadline, attend a lab section that fits your course schedule. Identify yourself to the TA as a student who is hoping to get into that lab. If you still don't have a lab section by the second lab, email cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca and describe your situation. Since you are registered in a lecture section, we will ensure that you end up in a lab section that fits your course schedule. This may not be your preferred lab section, however."
