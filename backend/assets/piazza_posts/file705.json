However, when I play around with it, I only end up with 4 functions being lifted compared to the stepper lifting up  all 6.\n;; what I thought would happen\n(define (one_0 x) (* x 1))\n(define (two_0 x) (* x b))\n(define (three_0 x) (* x n n n))\n(define b_0 (* n n))\n\n;; stepper\n(define (one_0 x) (* x 1))\n(define (two_0 x) (* x b_0))\n(define (three_0 x) (* x 1 1 1))\n(define a_0 1)\n(define b_0 1)\n(define c_0 1)\nDoes the local simply lift all functions inside it regardless of whether or not they are going to be used?

    "instructor_answer": "Notice that the question text says \"How many definitions are lifted each time b is called?\". It does not ask how many FUNCTION definitions are lifted.\nRenaming and lifting happens for all the definitions in a local."
