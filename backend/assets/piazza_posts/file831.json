    "title": "Question about Maze problem in lecture",
    "question": "Sorry if this is a really silly question, but I was re-working the maze problem from lecture, and the data definition for Position has the following:\n(@htdd Position)\n\n(define-struct pos (x y))\n;; Position is (make-pos Natural Natural)\n;; interp. an x, y position in the maze.\n;;         0, 0 is upper left.\n;;         a position is only valid for a given maze if:\n;;            - (<= 0 x (sub1 <size>))\n;;            - (<= 0 y (sub1 <size>))  \n;;            - there is a true in the given cell\n;;\n(define P0 (make-pos 0 0)) ;upper left  in 4x4 maze\n(define P1 (make-pos 3 0)) ;upper right  \"  \"   \"\n(define P2 (make-pos 0 3)) ;lower left   \"  \"   \"\n(define P3 (make-pos 3 3)) ;lower right  \"  \"   \"\nFor the examples provided, shouldn't lower right, for example, be (make-pos 4 4)?\nOne of the maze examples provided is\n(define M4\n  (list O O O O O\n        O W W W O\n        O W O O O\n        O W O W W\n        W W O O O))\nIf the upper left is 0,0 wouldn't the bottom right be (make-pos 4 4)?\nI'm also curious what is meant by \"size\" in (<= 0 x (sub1 <size>)) and\n                                                                    (<= 0 y (sub1 <size>)) \nwhen describing what a valid position in a maze is.\nGreatly appreciate any help\nEdit: I just read it again and 4x4 maze seems to be the thing I missed here. Thanks to anyone who can confirm this, and sorry about this.",
