    "title": "Is it ok to check the answer for a problem you're having trouble solving?",
    "question": "Just curious what everyone here does when they're stuck on a problem.\nI know it's good to go to office hours and piazza, but is it counter-productive to look at the solution, even if you think you understand the problem and the solution itself after? I'm just looking for some advice as to what's the best thing to do when you're stuck on a given practice problem and you have already reviewed the videos and lecture notes to death and tried as hard as you can on the problem",
    "student_answer": "Personally, my strategy is that if I really get stuck, then I look at only the part of the solution to give me a nudge in the right direction (and get me unstuck), and then continue on without looking at the solution. That way, I still retain most of the learning from actually doing the problem but it also allows me to better understand the parts where the solution helped me in contrast to just copying the whole solution.\nFor me at the very least, even if I do understand solution code, actually trying to go through the process of doing it with as little help as possible helps me learn the material much more than just understanding solution code. \nThis advice also applies to any course in general.",
