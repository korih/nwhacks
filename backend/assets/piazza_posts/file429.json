    "question": "For this function in problem 4 of the 2021 midterm, why don't we need to design a helper function? Isn't it doing a separate task when it compares the image areas since the purpose of the function is only to add areas? Thank You!",
    "student_answer": "I think it's because it's only calling one function on the different datatype.\n(also I would argue image-area is a helper function)",
