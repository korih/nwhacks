    "question": "hi i remember in one of the edx videos the instructor mentioned how drracket had a different plane in terms of the x and y values/ I just wanted to confirm if my understanding of this is correct.\nessentially there can be no negative x or y values. but you CAN have negative dx and dy values correct? I've attached an image below.",
    "student_answer": "You have to reverse the y axis. So positive y is going down, x is the same.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
