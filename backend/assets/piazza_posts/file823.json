    "question": "I was wondering if this is worth submitting a regrade as I know it is autograded or if I'm just wrong.\nHere is what the autograder says; both of my MR are present but it marked it as incorrect. \nHere is my fn-for-employee template of Problem 2:",
    "student_answer": "- you must NOT rename any of the local functions inside the template\nUnfortunately, I wouldn't think so, since the instructions told us not to change the names of the local functions (which is why the autograder failed to pick the changed function names up).",
