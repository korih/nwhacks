    "question": "edx video said that it can only use one function on refered to type, otherwise, need a natural helper function\non lecture, the professor said only can call for one selector, otherwise, need a natural helper\nfor example\nif we just need to (+ (selector 1) (selector 2)) for the refered type\nthis is indeed one function operator \"+\" , however, this consumes tow selectors \nwhether this one need natural helper function or not? ",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "First let's change your expression to:\n(+ (selector-1 x) (selector-2 x))\nWhich is probably what you intended to write.\nNote that + is not being called with x as an argument.  So it is not called on x.  Only the selectors are called on x.  So this code calls two selectors on x."
