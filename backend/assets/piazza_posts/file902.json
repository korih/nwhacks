    "question": "Are we not allowed to use string-ci<=? in our function body? When I tried handing it in, the autograder gives me a 0 on the questions and says that I have a contract violation.",
    "student_answer": "You can, but the contract violation might be telling you that your function has been written such that there is the potential for string-ci<=? to be handed an invalid data type somewhere. Maybe look closer at your function and see how you can rewrite it, or what you could add, to avoid that?",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
