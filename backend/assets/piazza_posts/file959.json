    "question": "Hi everyone, unfortunately I have COVID and need to take some sick days to rest. I anticipate I will be feeling better by the end of the week. I will respond to emails you've sent and post final lab/pset/lecture grades for the term then, no need to worry if you've requested accommodations, I will get back to you. Thank you for your patience and good luck with your studying and exams! \n- Emily",
