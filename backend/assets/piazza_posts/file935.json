    "student_answer": "@866:\nIf you are concerned about how you are doing I suggest you go to instructor office hours.  We can help you assess how things are going and come up with a plan to do better.\nIf you\u2019ve already taken this course once, I would suggest that you review your notes, review what you did not do well on, and \u2014 seriously \u2014 reflect on what happened, after the course has ended. There\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk during final exam season. Contacting instructors after Midterm 1 and Midterm 2 would have been good steps to ensure that you were on the right track. In addition, go to TA office hours \u2014 during exam season. There are resources in this course to help you succeed \u2014 but you must reach out for them.\nFailing a course is not indicative of anything. Failing it twice may indicate that perhaps some reflection was not done. No course is designed to set you up for failure. Take these lessons to heart. Sometimes, the most profound life lessons that one learns are from the most painful experiences.\nOf course, it\u2019s up to you to choose what is important at this stage in the course. Do you weigh CPSC 110 heavier than your other courses to pass \u2014 and also sacrifice time on your other courses? The choice is up to you.\nGood luck!",
