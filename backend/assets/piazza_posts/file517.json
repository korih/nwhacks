    "question": "OK I was probably being naive here, but I haven't been looking at Piazza for any help on problem sets, because:\n\"You are not allowed to ask anyone else any questions about the problem set, nor are you allowed to answer anyone else's questions.\"\nWith the PS5 deadline past, I was finally going to ask a question.  I was surprised to see several people had already asked questions and received answers, with no dreaded messages about academic misconduct etc. \nCan we get some clarification on what we are allowed to ask?  I'm happy if people get help, but I don't want to hold myself to a disadvantage for no reason.",
    "student_answer": "\"Please note that the Piazza discussion forum is the only approved forum for questions about problem sets. An instructor will answer questions that appear to identify mistakes in the problem sets, but to the greatest degree possible you are expected to do the problem sets yourselves. Getting too much help on problem sets often leads to doing very poorly on exams where that help is not available.\"\n\nI'm not 100% sure either. It's probably a good idea, either way, to ask for help only when you feel you've exhausted all your other options.",
