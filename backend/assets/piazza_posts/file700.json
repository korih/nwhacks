    "title": "encapsulated template tag",
    "question": "When do we use the encapsulated template tag? Is it anytime we use local when defining a function?\nAnd for the fn-composition template tag, do we use it even when we use 2 abstract functions together when defining a function? What are the restrictions around it? Thank you in advance for the clarification.",
    "student_answer": "From how I understand it, encapsulated is used when multiple mutual recursions (plus any necessary helpers) are combined into the local definition of a single function where the function body is just a single trampoline call.\nI think you do use fn-composition for combining abstract functions, given that the function body is only the composition of abstract functions.",
