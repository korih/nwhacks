    "title": "Why multiple bases in abstract fold functions?",
    "question": "I am wondering why when we are writing an abstract fold function there are sometimes multiple bases?\nIn problems like the one I've included below, where we tailor the fold function to the data definitions/ given information, the only ever \"false\" case would be empty, and therefore one base can be used in all parts that need to return empty. I suppose in certain functions the result might sometimes be, for example, empty-image and other times \"\", but for functions where this isn't true, why do we include multiple bases? \n(@htdf fold-person)\n(@signature (String Z B -> X) (Z X A -> Y) \n(Date -> Z) (X A -> A) (Y B -> B) A B Person \n-> X)\n\n(check-expect (fold-person make-person \nmake-marriage identity cons cons empty empty P3) P3)\n                           \n\n(define (fold-person c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 b1 b2 p)\n  (local [(define (fn-for-person p)\n            (c1 (person-name p)\n                 (fn-for-date (person-bdate p))\n                 (fn-for-lom (person-marriages                      \n                                          p))))\n\n(define (fn-for-marriage m)\n   (c2 (fn-for-date (marriage-date m))\n        (fn-for-person (marriage-spouse m))\n        (fn-for-lop (marriage-children m))))\n\n          (define (fn-for-date d)\n            (c3 d))\n\n          (define (fn-for-lop lop)\n            (cond [(empty? lop) b1]\n                  [else\n                   (c4 (fn-for-person (first \n                                         lop))\n                        (fn-for-lop (rest \n                                      lop)))]))\n\n          (define (fn-for-lom lom)\n            (cond [(empty? lom) b2]\n                  [else\n                   (c5 (fn-for-marriage (first \n                                           lom))\n                        (fn-for-lom (rest \n                                      lom)))]))]\n    (fn-for-person p)))",
    "student_answer": "For the reason that you mentioned. It could be different things. It doesn't have to be empty, and it can be anything, even a function. And the cases do not have to be the same, this is the copy test, but when you want to use the function, you might need something else.  ",
