    "question": "Hello! I noticed for section 203 that we're starting 2 one-of on Tuesday, but the L11 edX page says the pre-reading is just up to the end of Module 6 (Mutual Reference).\nI assume this means we don't need to watch any 2 one-of videos and the clicker questions will be all on Module 6?\nThanks!",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Problem set 5 is a big one, and it's super super important that you master the module 6 material, so we don't have addiitonal lecture prep for the first lecture of this week."
