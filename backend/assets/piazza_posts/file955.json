    "question": "Hey there!\nI was just wondering if anyone could give me an explanation (like, essentially the logic behind it) on why sometimes the appropriate thing to do is\n(append t-wl subs)\n, where \"subs\" are the subs of a node in a tree\nwhereas sometimes the appropriate thing to do is\n(append subs t-wl)\nI have ran into this situation quite a few times: when I do them in one order, a few of my tests fail. But then when I change the order, they all pass. ",
