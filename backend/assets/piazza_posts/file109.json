    "title": "How to find image shape in function?",
    "question": "Regarding the solution of question 4 on lecture 2 starter, is there a way to find the type of shape an image is? The area of all rectangles are base x height but the area of a circle is pi*r*2 not (2*r)^2. Is there a function like image-width that would work something like (image-type image) -> circle? (I looked through images.rkt but couldn't find anything). I would like to use this to have two separate area equations, one for area of rectangles and one for areas of circles.",
