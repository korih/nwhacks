    "question": "For ppl waitlisted, if you get a better mark on the waitlist quiz will this mean you have higher priority to get into the course? Does it matter how well you do on the waitlist quiz or just that you need to get it done? Like if I am high up on the waitlist, but do poorly on the waitlist quiz, will I be moved farther back in the list?",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "No, you have to pass the waitlist quiz, and your number on the list has to come up."
