    "question": "Hi, I am on the waitlist for this class. I read in the email that waitlisted students should keep up with the content in order to pass the waitlist quiz on the 18th. Will this course also appear on canvas for us, or should we keep up in another way? My other question is that if waitlisted students cannot register in a lab section, does that mean we lose marks from missing labs once we get into the course later? Thank you.",
    "student_answer": "Imo, you can access the lecture via Zoom links on pinned post. Also regarding waitlist students' Lab and Pset is introduced on the syllabus waitlist section. Hope it helps!\n\nFrom the syllabus>>\nNote that although students on the wait list are not allowed to attend labs, you must complete the labs anyways to learn the material. You are free to see a TA during office hours for feedback \u2014 this will not give you the lab marks, but you will be excused from these labs if you are moved into the class. Movement from the wait list into the course is dependent on both your wait list order and your ability to demonstrate that you have been doing work in the course from the first day of term. Please note that even if you are high up on the wait list, there is no guarantee that you will get in to the course.\nWait list students who are moved into the course should email\ncpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca\nASAP to confirm exemptions for the lab(s) they have missed while on the wait list.",
