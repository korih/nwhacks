    "question": "I'm having a bit of trouble interpreting what the type of the output should be for this question. The question asks for the total amount of gold AND the list of accessible treasures. I don't think (?) we've ever dealt with a function that has an output of two things ( i.e. (@signature X Y -> W Z)). Is it supposed to be something like (listof W (listof Z)) (although I'm pretty sure this is \"illegal\") or something else? Any help would be appreciated!\nedit: Also, side note, do we need to include the input treasure as one of the \"accessible treasures\" in the ouput? Thanks.",
    "student_answer": "A function can only have one output. Try reading the question description again while keeping this in mind; that's where your misunderstanding is.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
