    "question": "Hello,\nI was trying to use the genrec sort function for a list having duplicate values. The function produced (list 1 2) for (qsort (list 1 1 2)), and I can understand that this is because of the definition of <p? and >p? functions. (< or > x PIVOT)\nThen, I tried using (define (<p? x) (< = x PIVOT)) as well,  but it made racket going out of memory.\nSo, my question is: Is it possible to use (qsort (list 1 1 2)), and get (list 1 1 2) as answer.",
