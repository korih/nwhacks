    "question": "Good morning everyone,\nI was wondering if people were able to see any grades on their Canvas page yet?\nSo far, I don't have any grades posted on there and I have submitted all assigned problem sets and attended all my labs. I just wanted to know if grades haven't been posted yet or if I was having a specific issue with my Canvas.\nThank you in advance.",
    "student_answer": "Same in my case I am also not able to see my grades.",
    "instructor_answer": "Grades have not been posted to Canvas yet. Lab 1, Lab 2, and Problem Set 1 grades will be posted this afternoon. "
