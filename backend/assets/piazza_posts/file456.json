    "question": "This might be kind of a dumb question, but I just wanted to confirm anyway to be safe.\nDuring the midterm, are we expected to be looking at the camera/computer the entire time? Like what if we need to draw something out on paper or iPad, its fine if we look away from the camera/computer running Dr. Racket right?",
    "student_answer": "Yes, that should be fine! According to the rules you\u2019re allowed to have a printed out version of the recipe checklist as well so even if you\u2019re looking at that you\u2019d have to look away from the camera! I think the main rule is just that you have to have your camera on at a proper angle at all times.",
    "instructor_answer": "Not Found"
