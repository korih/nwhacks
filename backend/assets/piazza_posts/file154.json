    "question": "From the syllabus, \n\" If you still don't have a lab section by the second lab, email cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca and describe your situation. \"\nDoes that mean before the second lab and after the first lab? Or does it mean after the second lab I should contact the admin? \nI have written an email a week before and haven't heard back yet. If I don't hear back before today, should I just join which ever that fits into my schedule for the second lab next week?  ",
    "student_answer": "Not Found",
    "instructor_answer": "Yes, you should join a lab that fits into your schedule for the second lab next week and email cpsc110-admin@cs.ubc.ca AFTER your second lab but BEFORE the add/drop deadline (end of day on Friday, January 21).\nI am currently receiving a large volume of emails, many of which are questions that are answered on the syllabus or have been answered already on Piazza. I am currently only responding to the most urgent requests, but I will get to everyone's emails and resolve any registration issues before the add/drop deadline next week. Thank you for your patience! "
