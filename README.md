- encrypt your data
- encrypt your prompt
- encrypt your response

## Nice to have
- Secure protocol for data
- good ui
- ability to swap between datasets/models (they are tied together)

Built using FastAPI and React

Leverages Qdrant for vector database

And runs inference using Llama3 through Cloudflare workers
